byron 'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,
byron 'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
byron 'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'
byron 'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,
byron 'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil
byron 'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,

byron 'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?
byron 'Juanna.'--Well, a pretty name enough.
byron 'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse--

byron 'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation
byron 'Surgit amari aliquid'--the toll
byron 'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;
byron 'T is Lambro--'t is my father! Kneel with me--
byron 'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.
byron 'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave
byron 'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
byron 'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,
byron 'T is also of some moment to the latter:
byron 'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
byron 'T is also subject to the double danger
byron 'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
byron 'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,
byron 'T is bad, and may be better--all men's lot:
byron 'T is beautiful to see a matron bring
byron 'T is being too epic, and I must cut down
byron 'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
byron 'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen
byron 'T is but the living who are dumb.
byron 'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.
byron 'T is fine to see them scattering refusals
byron 'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey--
byron 'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
byron 'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
byron 'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
byron 'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue--
byron 'T is not address'd to you--the more 's the pity
byron 'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,
byron 'T is not mere splendour makes the show august
byron 'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!
byron 'T is not my present lot, as I have said,
byron 'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.
byron 'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,
byron 'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so--
byron 'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
byron 'T is odd, but true,--last war the News abounded
byron 'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
byron 'T is odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.
byron 'T is only that they love to throw away
byron 'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'
byron 'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
byron 'T is pity that it takes no farther hold
byron 'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
byron 'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,
byron 'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;
byron 'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,
byron 'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue
byron 'T is round him, near him, here, there, every where;
byron 'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,
byron 'T is said (for I 'll not answer above ground
byron 'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire
byron 'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
byron 'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
byron 'T is said that persons living on annuities
byron 'T is said the great came from America;
byron 'T is said--indeed a general complaint--
byron 'T is shadow'd by his cowl;
byron 'T is so becoming to the soul and face,
byron 'T is something, in the dearth of fame,
byron 'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind--
byron 'T is strange enough--the rough, tough soldiers, who
byron 'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'
byron 'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,
byron 'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses
byron 'T is surely Juan now--No! I 'm afraid
byron 'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,
byron 'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
byron 'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
byron 'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
byron 'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
byron 'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
byron 'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
byron 'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
byron 'T is that our nature cannot always bring
byron 'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.
byron 'T is the perception of the beautiful,
byron 'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;
byron 'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;
byron 'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is
byron 'T is therefore better looking before leaping--
byron 'T is thus the good will amiably err,
byron 'T is thus the spirit of a single mind
byron 'T is thus with people in an open boat,
byron 'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,--
byron 'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
byron 'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,
byron 'T is true that death awaits both you and me,
byron 'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne
byron 'T is true we speculate both far and wide,
byron 'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,
byron 'T is true, a little troubled here and there,
byron 'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;
byron 'T is true, you don't--but, pale and struck with terror,
byron 'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw
byron 'T is very certain the desire of life
byron 'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,
byron 'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;
byron 'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
byron 'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
byron 'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
byron 'T is--'t is her father's--fix'd upon the pair!
byron 'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
byron 'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,
byron 'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
byron 'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
byron 'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth
byron 'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
byron 'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,
byron 'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;
byron 'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
byron 'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:
byron 'T was difficult to get out such provision
byron 'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,
byron 'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,
byron 'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
byron 'T was fresh--for he had lately used the lock--
byron 'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
byron 'T was in November, when fine days are few,
byron 'T was merely known, that on a secret mission
byron 'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,
byron 'T was much that he was understood at all;
byron 'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,
byron 'T was not her fortune--he has enough without:
byron 'T was not to be expected that he should,
byron 'T was not without some reason, for the wind
byron 'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:--
byron 'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
byron 'T was rather her experience made her sage,
byron 'T was something calculated to allay
byron 'T was strange enough she should retain the impression
byron 'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
byron 'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
byron 'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
byron 'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down
byron 'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,
byron 'T was well, because health in the human frame
byron 'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet
byron 'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
byron 'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
byron 'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
byron 'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
byron 'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his
byron 'T were nothing--for her eyes flash'd always fire;
byron 'T were well if others follow'd my example.
byron 'T will be because our notion is not high
byron 'T will but precipitate a situation
byron 'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.
byron 'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
byron 'T will teach discernment to the sensitive,
byron 'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't)
byron 'T would give me pleasure.--Pray, what is your nation?'
byron 'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
byron 'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,
byron 'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'
byron 'That good but rarely came from good advice.'
byron 'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied
byron 'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,
byron 'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'
byron 'The prima donna, though a little old,
byron 'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor
byron 'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,
byron 'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,
byron 'The time is out of joint,'--and so am I;
byron 'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'--'Hold!'
byron 'Then up with me!'--But Juan answer'd, 'Look
byron 'There is a tide in the affairs of men
byron 'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
byron 'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
byron 'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof
byron 'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'--a chymic treasure
byron 'Tis not his conquests keep his name in fashion,
byron 'Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,
byron 'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,
byron 'Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;
byron 'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears
byron 'Tis time we should return to plain narration,
byron 'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
byron 'To be, or not to be?'--Ere I decide,
byron 'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'
byron 'To hear and to obey' had been from birth
byron 'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,
byron 'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant
byron 'True, 't is a pity--pity 't is, 't is true'),
byron 'Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,
byron 'Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,
byron 'Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,
byron 'Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.
byron 'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,
byron 'Twas the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may
byron 'Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked
byron 'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;
byron 'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit--'
byron 'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
byron 'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
byron 'We must be near some place of man's abode;--
byron 'We understand the splendid host intends
byron 'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?
byron 'What are ye?'--'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd
byron 'What dost thou know of love or feeling?--Wretch!
byron 'What follow'd?'--'A shot laid me on my back,
byron 'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?'
byron 'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'
byron 'Whence come ye?'--'From Constantinople last,
byron 'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty--'Where
byron 'Where will you serve?'--'Where'er you please.'--'I know
byron 'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'
byron 'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,
byron 'Why Fame--but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar--
byron 'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean
byron 'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault
byron 'Why?--Why?--Besides, Fred really was attach'd;
byron 'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,
byron 'Will please to accompany those gentlemen
byron 'Would we were masters now, if but to try
byron 'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.
byron 'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
byron 'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?
byron 'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'
byron 'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'
byron 'You served at Widdin?'--'Yes.'--'You led the attack?'
byron 'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded
byron 'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'
byron 'You were the first i' the breach?'--'I was not slack
byron 'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
byron 'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'
byron 'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie
byron 'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,
byron 'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:
byron 'Your coming has been unexpected here,
byron 'Your names?'--'Mine 's Johnson, and my comrade 's Juan;
byron ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's

byron ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
byron ('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth!

byron And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
byron And feeling, in a poet, is the source
byron And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,
byron And fell all ravenously on their provision,
byron And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
byron And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
byron And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;
byron And felt--though done with life--he was alone
byron And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
byron And fight like fiends for pay or politics.
byron And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
byron And find a deuced balance with the devil.
byron And fired it into one assailant's pudding--
byron And firmer faith no ladye--love desire;
byron And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,
byron And first he wonder'd why he had refused;
byron And first one universal shriek there rush'd,
byron And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,
byron And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,
byron And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,
byron And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
byron And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
byron And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
byron And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
byron And follow far the disappearing sun,
byron And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
byron And for his theme--he seldom sung below it,
byron And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
byron And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;
byron And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.
byron And for the effeminate villeggiatura--
byron And for the fame you would engross below,
byron And for the moment it had some effect;
byron And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
byron And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.
byron And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.
byron And for their rights connubial make a stand,
byron And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,
byron And form'd a basis of esteem, which ends
byron And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,
byron And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
byron And fought away with might and main, not knowing
byron And found him not amidst the various progenies
byron And found much linen, lace, and several pair
byron And found their lives were let at a short lease--
byron And founded Doctors' Commons:--I have conn'd
byron And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number
byron And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border
byron And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,
byron And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.
byron And fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'
byron And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally
byron And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
byron And full of promise, as the spring of prime.
byron And full of sentiments, sublime as billows
byron And further downward, tall and towering still, is
byron And further on a group of Grecian girls,
byron And gain an inch of staircase at a time.
byron And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,
byron And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
byron And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
byron And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.
byron And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,
byron And gazed around them to the left and right
byron And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.
byron And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
byron And girt by formidable waves; but they
byron And giving up all notions of resistance,
byron And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.
byron And glory long has made the sages smile;
byron And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
byron And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.
byron And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;
byron And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
byron And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
byron And grow quite figurative with their figures.
byron And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then
byron And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
byron And had it not been for some stray troops landing
byron And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.
byron And had retain'd his boyish look beyond
byron And haggard with a dissipated life,
byron And half a million for your Sabine farm
byron And half forgot their danger and despair:
byron And half of that opinion 's also mine.
byron And half retiring from the glowing arm,
byron And hands obey--our hearts are still our own.'
byron And happiest they who horses can engage;
byron And harder for the heart to overcome,
byron And hardly heaven--because it never ends.
byron And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
byron And harmonised by the old choral wall:
byron And hate all vice except its reputation.
byron And have not yet attain'd to much success.
byron And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
byron And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);--
byron And having casually glanced it through,
byron And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
byron And having lived with people of all ranks,
byron And having pick'd up several odds and ends
byron And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,
byron And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,
byron And he begun a long low island song
byron And he could even withstand that awkward test
byron And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;
byron And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he
byron And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
byron And he who understands it would be able
byron And he whose very body was all mind,
byron And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied
byron And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
byron And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.
byron And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
byron And heartless daughters--worn and pale and poor,
byron And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,
byron And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.
byron And hell and purgatory--but forgot
byron And hell, there must at least be six or seven.
byron And help them with a lie or two additional,
byron And hence arise the woes of sentiment,
byron And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
byron And hence some heathenish philosophers
byron And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd
byron And her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;
byron And her head droop'd as when the lily lies
byron And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.
byron And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
byron And here I leave them at their preparation
byron And here I must an anecdote relate,
byron And here Juanna kindly interposed,
byron And here and there some stern high patriot stood,
byron And here exactly follows what he said:--
byron And here he was--who upon woman's breast,
byron And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:
byron And here she summon'd Baba, and required
byron And here the advantage is my own, I ween
byron And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
byron And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:
byron And here we may remark with the historian,
byron And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,
byron And heroes are but made for bards to sing,
byron And hers were those which can face calculation,
byron And hew out a huge monument of pathos,
byron And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
byron And hide her little palpitating breast
byron And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
byron And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
byron And his disguise with due consideration
byron And his one blow left little work for two.
byron And hold up to the sun my little taper?
byron And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
byron And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
byron And horrid was the contrast to the view--
byron And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
byron And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:
byron And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
byron And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
byron And how the goddesses came down to men:
byron And how this heavy faintness pass'd away
byron And how to parry the renew'd attack?
byron And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.
byron And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!
byron And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal--
byron And huge tombs worse--mankind, since Adam fell:
byron And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,
byron And hurls at once his venom and his strength.
byron And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring
byron And if I had to give a casting voice,
byron And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
byron And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
byron And if he wept at length, they were not fears
byron And if his passions now and then outran
byron And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'
byron And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
byron And if in the mean time her husband died,
byron And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,
byron And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on
byron And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
byron And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
byron And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
byron And if their approbation we experience,
byron And if their full contents I do not give ye,
byron And if they had, they could not have secured
byron And if they should discover your disguise,
byron And if this violent remedy be tried--
byron And if we can but till the morning keep
byron And if we now and then a sigh must heave
byron And if you are not satisfied with that,
byron And if you had it o'er again--'t would pass--
byron And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
byron And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
byron And in each circumstance of love or war
byron And in perspective many a squadron flies:
byron And in such colours that they seem to live;
byron And in the Danube's waters shone the same--
byron And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,
byron And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
byron And in the midst a golden apple grew,--
byron And in the worn and wild receptacles
byron And in their native beauty stood avenged:
byron And in them crowded several of the crew;
byron And in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,
byron And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,
byron And in whatever aspect it arrays
byron And indications of hysterics, whose
byron And indigestion's grand multiplication
byron And infidels, to pull down every steeple,
byron And insolence no doubt is what they are
byron And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears
byron And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,
byron And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;
byron And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:
byron And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
byron And is there not religion, and reform,
byron And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?
byron And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
byron And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
byron And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,
byron And kings and consorts oft are mystified,
byron And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when
byron And knew such brightness was but the reflection
byron And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
byron And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,
byron And know no more of what is here, than there;--
byron And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
byron And largest, thinking it was just the thing
byron And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,
byron And lay before them with his children near,
byron And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;
byron And leaving land far out of sight, would skim
byron And lecturing on the noble art of killing,--
byron And led them back into the heaviest fire.
byron And left at large, like a young heir, to make
byron And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:
byron And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;
byron And left his widow to her own aversion.
byron And let few opportunities escape
byron And let the Babel round run as it may,
byron And levell'd weapons still against the glacis.
byron And life yields nothing further to recall
byron And lifting him with care into the cave,
byron And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:
byron And like some other things won't do to tell
byron And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:
byron And likes particularly to produce
byron And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.
byron And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.
byron And listening to the topics most in vogue;
byron And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
byron And lived contentedly, without complaints,
byron And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,
byron And lo! a fifth appears;--and what is she?
byron And long besides.'--'Oh! if 't is really so,
byron And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.
byron And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
byron And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
byron And long the latest of arrivals halts,
byron And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
byron And look down on the universe with pity,--
byron And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,
byron And look'd down over Attica; or he
byron And look'd extremely at the opening door,
byron And look'd upon it long, and when at last
byron And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek
byron And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,
byron And looking coldly in her face, he cried,
byron And looking like two incubi, they glared
byron And looking on her, as to look her through,
byron And looking on him with a sort of smile,
byron And looking, as he always look'd, perceived
byron And lost in wonder of so great a nation,
byron And lost virginity of oratory,
byron And louder than her breathing beats her heart.
byron And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings
byron And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.
byron And love of glory 's but an airy lust,
byron And love than either; and there would arise
byron And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'
byron And love too much, and yet can not love less;
byron And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
byron And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,
byron And lower the price of rouge--at least some winters.
byron And lying on their weariness like balm,
byron And made a loud and pious lamentation;
byron And made a scene men do not soon forget;
byron And made a signal to retreat at one.
byron And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.
byron And made at least five hundred good zecchini,
byron And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.
byron And made the very billows pay them toll.
byron And made them bale without a moment's ease,
byron And made them charge with bayonet these machines,
byron And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
byron And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
byron And make a music, whether flat or sharp.
byron And make no further noise, till you discover
byron And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
byron And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.
byron And makes our snow less pure than our morality;
byron And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,
byron And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.
byron And many deaths do they escape by this:
byron And march away--'t were easier done than said.'
byron And marriage also may exist without;
byron And matrons who would be no less secure,
byron And may appear so when the Dog Star rages,
byron And may become of great advantage when
byron And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,
byron And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.
byron And measures round of toises thousands three.
byron And men in nations;--all were his!
byron And merely for the sake of its own merits;
byron And merely practised as a sea-attorney.
byron And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'
byron And merely tend to show how greatly love is
byron And midnight listens to the lion's roar,
byron And mien excited general admiration--
byron And might have done so by the garden-gate,
byron And mildest, matron-like interpretation,
byron And mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,
byron And mingling modestly in toils or sports.
byron And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
byron And money, that most pure imagination,
byron And morals of the country from caprices
byron And more attracts by all it doth conceal--
byron And more might be found out, if I could poke enough
byron And more robust of figure,--then begun
byron And most of them had little clothes but rags.
byron And most of us have found it now and then;
byron And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
byron And much embarrassment in either eye;
byron And much more tender on the whole than fierce;
byron And musing there an hour alone,
byron And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
byron And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
byron And must thy lyre, so long divine,
byron And my internal spirit cut a caper:
byron And my success produced what I, in sooth,
byron And natural agonies, with a slight shade
byron And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
byron And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour
byron And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
byron And nearer as they came, a genial savour
byron And need he had of slumber yet, for none
byron And neutralize her outward show of scarlet.
byron And never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'
byron And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
byron And never having dreamt what 't was to bear
byron And never know the weight of human hours.
byron And never once he has had cause to scold,
byron And never ran away, except when running
byron And next a quarrel (as he seem'd to fret)
byron And next day paid a visit to his mother,
byron And next his savage virtue he accused,
byron And next proceeded quietly to cock.
byron And next she gave her (I say her, because
byron And next they thought upon the master's mate,
byron And night is flung off like a mourning suit
byron And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
byron And no great dilettanti in topography
byron And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
byron And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
byron And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,
byron And no one virtue yet, except starvation,
byron And noble births, nor dread the enumeration--
byron And none liked to anticipate the blow;
byron And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
byron And not a breath crept through the rosy air,
byron And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.
byron And not exactly either one or two;
byron And not from any love to you nor me.
byron And not in literature a great Drawcansir,
byron And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd
byron And not our own. I am too qualified
byron And not the fix'd--he knew the way to wheedle:
byron And not the least so when they are religious,
byron And not the pink of old hexameters;
byron And not to pour their ocean in a sieve.
byron And nothing outward tells of human clay;
byron And nought remains unseen, but much untold,
byron And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted
byron And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
byron And now I will proceed upon the pair.
byron And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;
byron And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,
byron And now and then it also suits my rhymes.
byron And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,
byron And now because I feel it growing dull.
byron And now being femininely all array'd,
byron And now commenced a strict investigation,
byron And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
byron And now he rose; and after due ablutions
byron And now in this new field, with some applause,
byron And now my epic renegade, what are ye at
byron And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'
byron And now there was a general sensation
byron And now they were diverted by their suite,
byron And now to business.--O my gentle Juan,
byron And now to see them, thus divided, stand
byron And now would chain them, to the very mind:--
byron And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
byron And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,
byron And now--what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?
byron And numerous party of his noble friends;
byron And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,
byron And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
byron And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
byron And oaks as olden as their pedigree
byron And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;
byron And of the folly of all prudish fears,
byron And of this Baba willingly took note,
byron And of variety there was no lack--
byron And offer poison long already mixed.
byron And offering, as usual, late assistance.
byron And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
byron And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
byron And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
byron And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,
byron And once o'er several country gentlemen.
byron And one by one her articles of dress
byron And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
byron And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose
byron And one good action in the midst of crimes
byron And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,
byron And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
byron And one or two sad, separate wives, without
byron And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
byron And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'
byron And only think, or act, or feel, with reference
byron And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,
byron And orders, and on all that he had done--
byron And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
byron And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.
byron And others of twelve consonants apiece;
byron And others rose to the command of crews
byron And others still their appetites constrain'd,
byron And others went on as they had begun,
byron And others, looking with a stupid stare,
byron And ought to go by quite another name.
byron And our Sophias are not so emphatic,
byron And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,
byron And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
byron And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,
byron And palsied fancy, which no longer roves
byron And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had
byron And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)
byron And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.
byron And pass, for want of better, though not new:
byron And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
byron And pensive to her father's house she went,
byron And persecuted sages teach the schools
byron And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,
byron And pick it up, and bite it to the core;
byron And pity lovers rather more than seamen.
byron And pitying sore his mutilated case,
byron And place them on their breast--but place to die--
byron And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.
byron And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
byron And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.
byron And plumage (probably it might have err'd
byron And pondering on the present and the past,
byron And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,
byron And prayers and other pious evolutions,
byron And present peril all before surpass'd,
byron And prophecy--except it should be dated
byron And proved it--'t was no matter what he said:
byron And pulling out reluctant purses, and
byron And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--
byron And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
byron And put himself upon his good behaviour:
byron And put his house in mourning several weeks,--
byron And put the business past all kind of doubt.
byron And quite enough for me to keep in mind;--
byron And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
byron And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,
byron And rally back his Romans to the field.
byron And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.
byron And rank'd with what is every day display'd--
byron And rapture's self will seem almost a pain
byron And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
byron And rash enthusiasm in good society
byron And rated him almost a whipper-in.
byron And rather calmly into the heart glides,
byron And rather held in than put forth his vigour;
byron And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,
byron And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd
byron And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
byron And read (the only book she could) the lines
byron And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'
byron And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;
byron And recollect a poet nothing loses
byron And recollect the work is only fiction,
byron And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
byron And redly ran his blushing waters down.
byron And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,--
byron And representative of all the race.
byron And revell'd in the fancies of the time,
byron And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,
byron And rich with all contrivances which grace
byron And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,
byron And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.
byron And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,
byron And round its once warm precincts palely lying
byron And round them ran a yellow border too;
byron And rushing in disorderly, though led,
byron And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes
byron And said she felt herself extremely well
byron And said that she was sorry she had cried.
byron And said there was analogy between 'em;
byron And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop
byron And sail for a new theme:--I have seen--and shook
byron And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
byron And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
byron And saw into herself each day before all
byron And saw the sun set opposite the moon.
byron And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,
byron And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
byron And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
byron And science profits by this resurrection--
byron And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
byron And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
byron And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;
byron And seated her all drooping by his side,
byron And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
byron And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:
byron And see a sentimental passion glow,
byron And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'-
byron And seem'd as if they had no further care;
byron And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
byron And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
byron And self would know what duty to attend.'
byron And senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,
byron And send him like a dove of promise forth.
byron And send the sentinel before your gate
byron And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;
byron And sent one on a summons to the pair,
byron And sent the doctors in a new direction.
byron And serious more than pensive, and serene,
byron And seriously resolved on reformation.
byron And set the other halt of earth to rights;
byron And set up in their stead some proper stuff.
byron And settled bonnets by the newest code,
byron And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:
byron And several pitied with sincere regret
byron And several strutted, others slept, and some
byron And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
byron And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
byron And she was chill as they, and on her face
byron And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,
byron And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
byron And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
byron And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
byron And shells and shot of every size and shape.
byron And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.
byron And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
byron And shine the very Siria of the spheres,
byron And ships, by thousands, lay below,
byron And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
byron And shone in the best part of dialogue,
byron And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,
byron And should he have forgotten her so soon?
byron And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,
byron And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
byron And show them what an intellectual war is.
byron And show'd but little royal curiosity:
byron And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
byron And shriek for water into a deaf ear,--
byron And shudder;--while, as beautiful as May,
byron And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.
byron And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;
byron And simple in the world, and doth not need
byron And since 'there 's safety in a multitude
byron And since that time it need not cost much showing,
byron And since that time there has not been a second.
byron And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
byron And singing birds without were heard to warble;
byron And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.
byron And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
byron And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
byron And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb
byron And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
byron And smiling but in secret--cunning rogue!
byron And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud
byron And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell
byron And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
byron And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
byron And so I interfered, and with the best
byron And so all ye, who would be in the right
byron And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,
byron And so good night to them,--or, if you will,
byron And so good night.--Return we to our story:
byron And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
byron And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,
byron And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
byron And so he says no more--but pays his court
byron And so is spring about the end of May;
byron And so it was, in proper time and place;
byron And so may every one except a dunce,
byron And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.
byron And so she took the liberty to state,
byron And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint
byron And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream
byron And so they fell in love;--she with his face,
byron And so they were submitted first to her, all,
byron And so, in short, the girls they really were
byron And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;
byron And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,
byron And so--she awoke with a great scream and start.
byron And sober suns must set at five o'clock.
byron And solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'
byron And sold him instantly when out of danger.
byron And some of them had lost their recollection,
byron And some of them high names: I have also known
byron And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'
byron And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.
byron And some such visions cross'd her majesty,
byron And some who had but talent for their crest;
byron And something like a smile upon her cheek.
byron And something roll'd before her in a sheet,
byron And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;
byron And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
byron And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
byron And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;
byron And sparkled into basins, where it spent
byron And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,
byron And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise--
byron And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who
byron And spoke more of the baron than the monk.
byron And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
byron And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
byron And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er
byron And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
byron And still a sort of fisherman was he;
byron And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,
byron And still less guessing where they might be going;
byron And still less was it sensual; for besides
byron And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,
byron And still more nearly to the place advancing,
byron And still more women, spring from not employing
byron And still pursues the right;--to curb the bad
byron And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
byron And still they seem resentfully to feel
byron And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.
byron And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
byron And stood within his hall at eventide;
byron And stripp'd and look'd to--But why should I ad
byron And strives to strangle him before he die.
byron And stumbled almost every step she made;
byron And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
byron And such I mean to make him when I reign.
byron And such a straw, borne on by human breath,
byron And such an end! that he who many a day
byron And such are many--though I only meant her
byron And such as they are, such my present tale is,
byron And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
byron And such sweet girls--I mean, such graceful ladies,
byron And such their creed was, till they were invaded,
byron And such they are--and such they will be found:
byron And such things as the entrails and the brains
byron And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
byron And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,
byron And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
byron And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all
byron And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
byron And swearing if the infant came to ill
byron And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,
byron And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
byron And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.
byron And swimming long in the abyss of thought
byron And taciturn Asiatic disposition
byron And take all colours--like the hands of dyers.
byron And take my word, you won't have any less.
byron And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'
byron And taking hints in good part all the while,
byron And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,
byron And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,
byron And talk in tender horrors of our loathing
byron And talk'd away--and might have talk'd till now,
byron And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,
byron And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,
byron And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.
byron And tell them--But you won't, and I have prated
byron And tells me to resume my story here.
byron And tenderness, and infancy; but now
byron And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
byron And that 's enough; succeeded in my youth,
byron And that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;
byron And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
byron And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
byron And that 's the moral of this composition,
byron And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.
byron And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;
byron And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:
byron And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
byron And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;
byron And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest
byron And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.
byron And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'
byron And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;
byron And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
byron And that his Argus--bites him by the breeches.
byron And that his father was an honest blacksmith,
byron And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
byron And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,
byron And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds
byron And that outrageous appetite for lies
byron And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,
byron And that so loudly, that upstarted all
byron And that still keeping up the old connection,
byron And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
byron And that the medicine answer'd very well;
byron And that the rest had faced unto the right
byron And that their books have but one style in common--
byron And that they have been so we all have read,
byron And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,
byron And that was of a fascinating kind.
byron And that which after all my spirit vexes,
byron And that which chiefly proved his saving clause
byron And that which farther aided them to strive
byron And that's the reason why you do--or do not.
byron And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
byron And the Pope thunder excommunication,
byron And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
byron And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
byron And the calumniated queen Semiramis.
byron And the deep passions flashing through her form
byron And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
byron And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
byron And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:
byron And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd
byron And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly
byron And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
byron And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.
byron And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
byron And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,
byron And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
byron And the new births of both their stale virginities
byron And the pause follow'd, which when song expires
byron And the perplexity could not be told
byron And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.
byron And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,
byron And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
byron And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
byron And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
byron And the sea dashes round the promontory,
byron And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,
byron And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,
byron And the sky shows that very ancient gray,
byron And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
byron And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot
byron And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
byron And the sweet consequence of large society,
byron And the two are so mix'd with human dust,
byron And the two last have left me many a token
byron And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
byron And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
byron And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
byron And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.
byron And the young beams of the excluded sun,
byron And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,
byron And their compassion grew to such a size,
byron And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
byron And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'
byron And then I have the worst dreams that can be,
byron And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
byron And then as an improvement 't will be shown:
byron And then before sighs cease; for oft the one
byron And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
byron And then decide, without great wrong to either,
byron And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
byron And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,
byron And then flew out into another passion.
byron And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
byron And then he added, that he needs must say,
byron And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,
byron And then he danced;--all foreigners excel
byron And then he had an ear for music's sound,
byron And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd
byron And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,
byron And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.
byron And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
byron And then he tried to muster all his patience.
byron And then held out his jugular and wrist.
byron And then her sex's shame broke in at last,
byron And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.
byron And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;
byron And then his only garment quite gave way;
byron And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
byron And then men stare, as if a new ass spake
byron And then moved on again with rapid pace;
byron And then my stoicism leaves nought behind
byron And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
byron And then of these some part burst into tears,
byron And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
byron And then once more his feelings back were brought,
byron And then retreated soberly--at ten.
byron And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,
byron And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
byron And then she had all Seville for abettors,
byron And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
byron And then she looks so modest all the while.
byron And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe
byron And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,
byron And then the merchant giving change, and signing
byron And then the mother cries, the father swears,
byron And then there 's the Grotesca--such a dancer!
byron And then there was a general competition,
byron And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,
byron And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
byron And then they left off eating the dead body.
byron And then they look'd around them and despair'd,
byron And then they stared each other's faces round:
byron And then they were too many, though so few--
byron And then this best and weakest woman bore
byron And then went down the hatchway one by one.
byron And then what proper person can be partial
byron And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,
byron And then with violence the old ship righted.
byron And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,
byron And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
byron And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
byron And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
byron And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
byron And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.
byron And then, if matters could be made up now;
byron And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;
byron And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;
byron And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.
byron And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,
byron And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,
byron And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
byron And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
byron And there he stood to take, and take again,
byron And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater
byron And there he went ashore without delay,
byron And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
byron And there is much which could not be appreciated
byron And there we go:--but where? five bits of lead,
byron And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
byron And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
byron And there, a little shelter'd from the shot,
byron And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
byron And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,
byron And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
byron And therefore leave them to the purer page
byron And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
byron And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,
byron And therefore side by side were gently laid,
byron And therefore we must give the greater number
byron And therefore what I throw off is ideal--
byron And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
byron And therefore worthy of commemoration:
byron And therefore, though 't is by no means my way
byron And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
byron And these are things which ask a tender tear,
byron And these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came
byron And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both
byron And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;
byron And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
byron And they continued battling hand to hand,
byron And they had wasted now almost a quarter.
byron And they were happy, for to their young eyes
byron And they who waited once and worshipp'd--they
byron And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
byron And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
byron And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!
byron And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
byron And this addition with such gems was bound
byron And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
byron And this omission, like that of the bust
byron And this reflection brings me to plain physics,
byron And this same state we won't describe: we would
byron And this they say in language rather rough.
byron And this was admirable; for so hot
byron And this young fellow--say what can he do?
byron And this, and his not knowing how much oats
byron And those that sate upon them, let it be
byron And though 't is true that man can only die once,
byron And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
byron And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair
byron And though I have seen many corpses, never
byron And though at first their strength it might renew,
byron And though he wish'd extremely to get through
byron And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,
byron And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
byron And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,
byron And though not vainer from his past success,
byron And though so much inferior, as I know,
byron And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
byron And though the duty wax'd a little hard,
byron And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,
byron And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
byron And though, as you remember, in a fit
byron And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
byron And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
byron And through her dear brunette complexion shone
byron And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
byron And thrown into the sea.--Thus Baba spoke
byron And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,
byron And thus Death laughs,--it is sad merriment,
byron And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,
byron And thus I supplicate your supposition,
byron And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as
byron And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach
byron And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee
byron And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,
byron And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,
byron And thus heroically stood resign'd,
byron And thus in every look she saw exprest
byron And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
byron And thus like to an angel o'er the dying
byron And thus my narrative proceeds:--Dudu,
byron And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,
byron And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
byron And thus they form a group that 's quite antique,
byron And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,
byron And thus they parted, each by separate doors;
byron And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,
byron And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
byron And thus upon his elbow he arose,
byron And thus we see--who doubts the Morning Post?
byron And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's
byron And thus your houri (it may be) disputes
byron And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
byron And till she doth, I fain must be content
byron And timidly expanding into life.
byron And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,
byron And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
byron And to the beauties of a foreign dame,
byron And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
byron And trace it in this poem every line:
byron And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,
byron And transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.
byron And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
byron And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;
byron And tremulously gentle her small hand
byron And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.
byron And tried to make a landing on the main;
byron And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
byron And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
byron And trousers not so tight that they would burst,
byron And truant husband should return, and say,
byron And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,
byron And tumble downward like the flying fish
byron And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
byron And tune the concord to a finer mood.
byron And turn on things which no aristocratic
byron And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!
byron And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.
byron And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
byron And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,
byron And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;
byron And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
byron And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;--
byron And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,--
byron And very handsome supernatural scenery.
byron And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
byron And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
byron And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
byron And waited but the signal's voice to burst
byron And walking out upon the beach, below
byron And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;
byron And wander'd up and down as in a dream,
byron And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
byron And was beleaguer'd both by land and water
byron And was not likely all at once to burst
byron And was not the best wife, unless we call
byron And was not to be held in leading strings;'
byron And was received with all the due grimace
byron And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
byron And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,
byron And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew
byron And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much
byron And waxing chiller in her courtesy,
byron And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
byron And wear my head, denying that I wear it.
byron And wear the Melton jacket for a space:
byron And wedded unto one she had loved well--
byron And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
byron And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,
byron And were her object only what 's call'd glory,
byron And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
byron And what 's still stranger, left behind a name
byron And what I write I cast upon the stream,
byron And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
byron And what is that? Devotion, doubtless--how
byron And what is worse still, a much longer story:
byron And what not, though he rode beyond all price,
byron And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
byron And what they pleased to do with the young khan
byron And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,
byron And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,
byron And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;
byron And when I think upon a pot of beer--
byron And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'
byron And when at last the pretty creature gets
byron And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
byron And when aught is to befall
byron And when he did, he found himself at sea,
byron And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,
byron And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
byron And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd
byron And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
byron And when so, you shall have the overture.
byron And when the delicacies of the law
byron And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'
byron And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
byron And when the sun set where were they?
byron And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,
byron And when they deem'd its moisture was complete
byron And when they grew so--on their new-found lantern,
byron And when they have made the shore through every shock,
byron And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,
byron And when to hold his tongue, now held it till
byron And when we once were fairly out, and when
byron And when well practised in these mimic scenes,
byron And when you add to this, her womanhood
byron And when you hear historians talk of thrones,
byron And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,
byron And where are they? and where art thou,
byron And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'
byron And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?
byron And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,
byron And where--oh, where the devil are the rents?
byron And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?
byron And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,
byron And wherefore this exordium?--Why, just now,
byron And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify
byron And whether he had occupied their station;
byron And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?
byron And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?
byron And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
byron And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose
byron And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'
byron And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'--consented.
byron And who should die to be his fellow's food.
byron And who that recollects young years and loves,--
byron And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.
byron And whom for this at last must we condemn?
byron And why and wherefore no one understands.
byron And why should I not form my speculation,
byron And why? because a little--odd--old man,
byron And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.
byron And why?--because it brings self-approbation;
byron And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin
byron And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
byron And will not toss and chatter the night through.
byron And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.
byron And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;
byron And wish'd that others held the same opinion;
byron And wishing that post-horses had the wings
byron And witches unto none, though somewhat late
byron And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
byron And with all passions in their turn attack'd;
byron And with it all the process of digestion.
byron And with that gentle, serious character,
byron And with the pages of the last Review
byron And with them their two sons, of whom the one
byron And without that, their poison and their claws
byron And without turning his facetious head,
byron And without word, a sign her finger drew on
byron And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
byron And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing
byron And wonder Providence is not more sage.
byron And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,
byron And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
byron And wonders why the devil he got heirs.
byron And words repeated after her, he took
byron And work away like spirit upon matter,
byron And works of the same pottery, bad or good,
byron And worse off than we hitherto have been;
byron And worthy of the noblest pedigree
byron And would not brook at all this sort of thing
byron And wounded several shutters, and some boards.
byron And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,
byron And written lately two memoirs upon't),
byron And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.
byron And yet 't is not affected, I opine.
byron And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink
byron And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,
byron And yet I know no more than the mahogany
byron And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
byron And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,
byron And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,
byron And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.
byron And yet at last he managed to get through
byron And yet but made a middling grenadier.
byron And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
byron And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone
byron And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
byron And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
byron And yet she did not want to reach the moon,
byron And yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:
byron And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.
byron And yet the rest rush'd eagerly--no wonder,
byron And yet their present hope was hardly more
byron And yet they had their little jealousies,
byron And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.
byron And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
byron And yet what are your other evidences?
byron And yet who can believe it? I would shatter
byron And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
byron And yet, like all men else, I must allow,
byron And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,
byron And you an equal courtesy should show.'
byron And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,
byron And you may get the wedding dresses ready.
byron And you shall see who has the properest notion
byron And you will be perhaps surprised to find
byron And you will find her sum of years in plenty.
byron And you will find us not top fond of joking.'
byron And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror
byron And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,
byron And young beginners may as well commence
byron And your cold people are beyond all price,
byron And your true feelings fully understood,
byron And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,
byron And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves
byron And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but
byron And, after swallowing down a slight refection,
byron And, as he interrupted not, went eking
byron And, as he thought, in country much the same--
byron And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe
byron And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart
byron And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
byron And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,
byron And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,
byron And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,
byron And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.
byron And, having o'er itself no further power,
byron And, if still free, that such or such a lover
byron And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
byron And, it might be from thought or toil or study,
byron And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
byron And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its

byron Because they are so;--a male Mrs. Fry,
byron Because they can't find out the very spot
byron Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
byron Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
byron Because they were constructed in a hurry;
byron Because, as suits their rank and situation,
byron Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
byron Because, though I am but a simple noddy,
byron Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,
byron Because, till people know what 's come to pass,
byron Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;--
byron Because--such was his magic power to please--
byron Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank
byron Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,
byron Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.
byron Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.
byron Been one to which a good heart could be partial--
byron Been stove in the beginning of the gale;
byron Been their familiar, and now Death was here.
byron Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell
byron Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,
byron Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.
byron Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,
byron Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?
byron Before and after; but now grown more holy,
byron Before he came, especially at night;
byron Before he can escape from so much danger
byron Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);
byron Before one charm or hope had taken wing.
byron Before the bridal hours have danced their measure
byron Before the consequences grow too awful;
byron Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
byron Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,
byron Before the sea until it should grow fine,
byron Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
byron Before them, and fair slaves on every side;
byron Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,
byron Before they enter'd, Baba paused to hint
byron Before they find an hour to introduce it;
byron Before they give their broadside. By and by,
byron Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:
byron Before, being badly seconded just then)
byron Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.
byron Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
byron Began to blush up to the eyes, and then
byron Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,
byron Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--
byron Began to lay about with steel and lead--
byron Began to signalise the Russ retreat,
byron Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.
byron Began to think the duchess' conduct free;
byron Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'
byron Began, as is the consequence of fear,
byron Begg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'-
byron Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'
byron Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;--
byron Begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes--'and do
byron Begot--but that 's to come--Well, to renew:
byron Behaved no better than a common sempstress.
byron Beheld his native Spain receding far:
byron Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,
byron Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,
byron Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He
byron Behold the world! and curse your victories!
byron Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,
byron Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,
byron Being long married, and thus set at large,
byron Being much too gross to see them in detail,
byron Being only injured by his own assertion.
byron Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,
byron Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;
byron Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,
byron Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,
byron Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked
byron Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'
byron Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who

byron Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'
byron Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd
byron Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
byron Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk
byron Below her breast was fasten'd with a band
byron Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,
byron Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,
byron Beneath the influence of the eastern star.
byron Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee.
byron Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!
byron Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair
byron Beseeching she no further would refuse,
byron Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
byron Besides (alas! his taste--forgive and pity!)
byron Besides Platonic love, besides the love
byron Besides being much averse from such a fate,
byron Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall
byron Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
byron Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;
byron Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot
byron Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,
byron Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,
byron Besides the ministers and underlings,
byron Besides the most sublime of--Heaven knows what else:
byron Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense
byron Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:
byron Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,
byron Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,
byron Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;
byron Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
byron Besides, as has been said, she was so fair
byron Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,
byron Besides, he had found out he was no tutor
byron Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
byron Besides, he had some qualities which fix
byron Besides, he was of that delighted age
byron Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more
byron Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
byron Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
byron Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:
byron Besides, so very beautiful was she,
byron Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,
byron Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
byron Besides, the sad 's a source of the sublime,
byron Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
byron Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;
byron Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
byron Between his own and others' intellect;
byron Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.
byron Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave
byron Between the British cabinet and Russian,
byron Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,
byron Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.
byron Between the present and past worlds, and hover
byron Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;
byron Between their present and their future state;
byron Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
byron Between these nations as a main of cocks,
byron Between two worlds life hovers like a star,
byron Between young persons without any danger.
byron Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;--
byron Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
byron Beyond a single gentleman's belief.
byron Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,--but would much rather
byron Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,
byron Beyond the best apothecary's art,
byron Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
byron Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,
byron Beyond the rules of posting,--and the mob
byron Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show
byron Bills, beasts, and men, and--no! not womankind!
byron Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:
byron Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,
byron Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair
byron Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,
byron Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,
byron Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!
byron Blood, until heated--and even then his own
byron Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
byron Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;
byron Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;
byron Blue as the garters which serenely lie
byron Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances
byron Blushes for those who will not:--but to sigh
byron Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless
byron Blushing with Bacchant coronals along
byron Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
byron Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,
byron Bob Southey! You're a poet, poet laureate,
byron Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.
byron Boded no good, whatever it express'd,
byron Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend
byron Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.
byron Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!
byron Boldly referring to the list of peers
byron Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,--
byron Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?
byron Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,
byron Born in a second wedlock; and above
byron Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,--
byron Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,
byron Boscan, or Garcilasso;--by the wind
byron Both in performance and in preparation;
byron Both lawyers and both men of education;
byron Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.
byron Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
byron Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
byron Both senates see their nightly votes participated
byron Both to the duchess and diplomatist,
byron Both were so young, and one so innocent,
byron Both wits--one born so, and the other bred--
byron Bought up for different purposes and passions.
byron Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
byron Brave men were living before Agamemnon
byron Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
byron Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
byron Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
byron Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
byron Brief, but delightful--such as had not staid
byron Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
byron Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
byron Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
byron Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
byron Bright with the very weakness he reproved;
byron Bright--and as black and burning as a coal;
byron Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung
byron Bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,
byron Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
byron Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed
byron Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;
byron Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
byron Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:--
byron Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
byron Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
byron Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
byron Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;
byron But 'Damme' 's quite ethereal, though too daring--
byron But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'
byron But 't is a name so spread o'er 'Sir' and 'Madam,'
byron But 't is as well at once to understand,
byron But 't was a public feast and public day,--
byron But 't was a transient tremor;--with a spring
byron But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
byron But Adeline had not the least occasion
byron But Adeline was far from that ripe age,
byron But Adeline was not indifferent: for
byron But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,
byron But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
byron But Destiny and Passion spread the net
byron But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
byron But Donna Inez, to divert the train
byron But Glory's glory; and if you would find
byron But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.
byron But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,
byron But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
byron But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
byron But I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.
byron But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,
byron But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)--
byron But I 'm too great a patriot to record
byron But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
byron But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred
byron But I am not so sure I should have smiled
byron But I am sick of politics. Begin,
byron But I being fond of true philosophy,
byron But I detest all fiction even in song,
byron But I grow sad--and let a tale grow cold,
byron But I have motives, whether wise or silly,
byron But I have spoken of all this already--
byron But I must do my duty--how thou hast
byron But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
byron But I shall add them in a brief appendix,
byron But I will fall at least as fell my hero;
byron But I won't weep!--and so drive on, postilions!
byron But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
byron But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
byron But Johnson only ran off, to return
byron But Johnson was a clever fellow, who
byron But Juan also shared in her austerity,
byron But Juan had been early taught to range
byron But Juan had got many things to leave,
byron But Juan never left them, while they had charms,
byron But Juan now is stepping from his carriage
byron But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,
byron But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke
byron But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child
byron But Juan was a bachelor--of arts,
byron But Juan was immovable; until
byron But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero
byron But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd
byron But Juan was not meant to die so soon.
byron But Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'
byron But Juan was received with much 'empressement:'-
byron But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?
byron But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,
byron But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
byron But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
byron But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
byron But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
byron But London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes
byron But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,
byron But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,
byron But Saint Augustine has the great priority,
byron But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly
byron But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:
byron But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,
byron But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
byron But Tom's no more--and so no more of Tom.
byron But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
byron But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
byron But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,
byron But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like
byron But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
byron But Zoe, being older than Haidee,
byron But a mere airy and fantastic basis,
byron But a mere modern must be moderate--
byron But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
byron But a third motive was as probably
byron But a white baracan, and so transparent
byron But after all it is the only 'bower'
byron But after all they are a North-West Passage
byron But after being fired at once or twice,
byron But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,
byron But all his great preparatives for dying
byron But all that power was wasted upon him,
byron But all the better, for the happy pair
byron But all these, save the last, being obsolete,
byron But all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?
byron But all was gentle and aristocratic
byron But almost every other country 's blue,
byron But almost sanctify the sweet excess
byron But always at a most provoking height;--
byron But always without malice: if he warr'd
byron But an extraneous mixture, which no pen
byron But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!
byron But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number
byron But as for Juan, he had no more notion
byron But as he had some lucid intermissions,
byron But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd--
byron But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all
byron But as it was, his Highness had to hold
byron But as the Danube could not well be waded,
byron But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,
byron But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
byron But as to women, who can penetrate
byron But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?
byron But at least I have shunn'd the common shore,
byron But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
byron But at the least you may die gloriously.'
byron But at this hour I wish to part in peace,
byron But be it as it may, a bard must meet
byron But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
byron But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
byron But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.
byron But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,
byron But being qualified in one way yet,
byron But being the prima donna's near relation,
byron But being thirstiest at the moment, he
byron But bid my women form the milky way.
byron But both together form a kind of centaur,
byron But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.
byron But bred within the March of old Ancona,
byron But buried in the heap of such transactions
byron But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,
byron But by degrees their senses were restored,
byron But by degrees, that they were fairer far
byron But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
byron But by the mass who go below without
byron But can't find any in the present age
byron But certain 'tis they all felt for their new
byron But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,
byron But certes matters took a different face;
byron But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
byron But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
byron But closed its little being without light,
byron But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.
byron But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,
byron But coughs will come when sighs depart--and now
byron But could not eat them, being in his turn
byron But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:
byron But could we know them in detail, perchance
byron But county contests cost him rather dearer,
byron But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
byron But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
byron But do you more, Sempronius--don't deserve it,'
byron But don't pretend to settle which was best.
byron But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,
byron But dreams of what has been, no more to be.
byron But else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,
byron But ended in his being found out and sack'd,
byron But ere he went, he added a slight hint,
byron But ere the middle watch was hardly over,
byron But ere they came to this, they that day shared
byron But ere they could perform this pious duty,
byron But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.
byron But even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,
byron But even the faintest relics of a shrine
byron But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,
byron But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,
byron But every fool describes in these bright days
byron But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
byron But fair as then, or fairer to behold.
byron But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,
byron But finding no place for their landing better,
byron But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;
byron But fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws
byron But flank'd by five brave sons (such is polygamy,
byron But for a cavalier of his condition
byron But for a child, what piece of work is here!
byron But for domestic quarrels one will do.
byron But for post-horses who finds sympathy?
byron But for the destiny of this young troop,
byron But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.
byron But for the present, gentle reader! and
byron But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known
byron But found my very innocence perplex
byron But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning
byron But from the river the town 's open quite,
byron But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,
byron But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.
byron But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'
byron But go they must at once, and will I--nill I.
byron But great things spring from little:--Would you think,
byron But harrow up his feelings till they wither,
byron But has not answer'd like the apparatus
byron But have not learn'd to wish it any less.
byron But he died early; and when he was gone,
byron But he had genius,--when a turncoat has it,
byron But he had got Haidee into his head:
byron But he had seen so much love before,
byron But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:
byron But he would not be taken, and replied
byron But he, more modest, took an humbler range
byron But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--
byron But hear that several people take exception
byron But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
byron But heaven must be diverted; its diversion
byron But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,
byron But here I leave the general concern,
byron But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,
byron But here Katinka interfered, and said,
byron But here a messenger brought in despatches:
byron But here a small delay forms a great crime:
byron But here a sort of scene began to ensue:
byron But here are men who fought in gallant actions
byron But here he was!--where each tie that can bind
byron But here is one prescription out of many:
byron But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:
byron But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,
byron But here the effect fell short of their desire:
byron But his adventures form a sorry sight;
byron But his just now were spread as is a cushion
byron But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
byron But how shall I relate in other cantos
byron But how to fill up that same vacant part?
byron But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there
byron But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:
byron But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
byron But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,
byron But if there 's anything in which I shine,
byron But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,
byron But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.
byron But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in
byron But in a style becoming his condition.
byron But in good company--the gout or stone.
byron But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
byron But in his silence there was much to rue,
byron But in old England, when a young bride errs,
byron But in such matters Russia's mighty empress
byron But in the country ladies seek their bower
byron But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
byron But in the noontide of the moon, and when
byron But in the same small minute, every sin
byron But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,
byron But in this case I also must remark,
byron But innocence is bold even at the stake,
byron But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'
byron But it suffices--little was amiss;
byron But it was all a mystery. Here we are,
byron But it will serve to keep my verse compact)-
byron But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,
byron But just suppose that moment should betide,
byron But just to play with, as an infant plays.
byron But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.
byron But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
byron But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.
byron But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;
byron But let it go:--it will one day be found
byron But let me change this theme which grows too sad,
byron But let me put an end unto my theme:
byron But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
byron But let me to my story: I must own,
byron But let that pass:--I think I have heard your name
byron But let us die like men, not sink below
byron But let us to the story as before.
byron But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,
byron But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
byron But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail
byron But like two beings born from out a rill,
byron But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,
byron But luckily of no great length or weight.
byron But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
byron But man is a carnivorous production,
byron But many a Greek maid in a loving song
byron But may their very memory perish too!-
byron But merely their parental tenderness,
byron But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
byron But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,
byron But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:
byron But more imprudent grown with every visit,
byron But more or less continue still to tease on,
byron But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,
byron But mostly sings of human things and acts--
byron But my best canto, save one on astronomy,
byron But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
byron But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime
byron But neither love nor hate in much excess;
byron But never in his real and serious mood;
byron But never mind,--she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;
byron But never mind;--'God save the king!' and kings!
byron But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
byron But never yet (except of course a miss
byron But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there--do go.
byron But no device could be brought into play--
byron But no doubt every thing is for the best--
byron But no one doubted on the whole, that she
byron But no one dreams of ever being short.-
byron But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,
byron But no one troubled him with conversation.
byron But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
byron But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her--
byron But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union
byron But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
byron But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
byron But not a word could Juan comprehend,
byron But not as yet imagined it could be
byron But not at all adapted to my rhymes.
byron But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on
byron But not by the same door through which came in
byron But not enough to show the imperial halls,
byron But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
byron But not my fault--I tell them all in time.
byron But not the less for this to be depreciated:
byron But not with violence; the stars shone out,
byron But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
byron But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
byron But now I 'm going to be immoral; now
byron But now I choose to break off in the middle,
byron But now I must transfer her to the charge
byron But now I will begin my poem. 'T is
byron But now at thirty years my hair is grey
byron But now being lifted into high society,
byron But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha
byron But now it flow'd in natural and fast,
byron But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,
byron But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;
byron But now reduced, as is a bulky volume
byron But now the town is going to be attack'd;
byron But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
byron But now there came a flash of hope once more;
byron But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,
byron But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,
byron But of all truths which she has told, the most
byron But of all verse, what most ensured her praise
byron But of inferior materials: she
byron But of materials that much shock the Muse--
byron But of such friendship as man's may to man be
byron But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
byron But of the portion which attack'd by water,
byron But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
byron But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!
byron But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!
byron But on the thirteenth, when already part
byron But on the whole their continence was great;
byron But on the whole, to general admiration
byron But on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,
byron But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,
byron But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)
byron But one arise,--we come, we come!'
byron But one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,
byron But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
byron But one which Baba did not like to brave,
byron But one who is not so youthful as she was
byron But only give a bust of marriages;
byron But other speculations were, in sooth,
byron But others ponder'd on a new dissection,
byron But overwrought with passion and despair,
byron But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
byron But pays off moments in an endless shower
byron But people's ancestors are history's game;

byron Crime came not near him--she is not the child
byron Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,

byron DEDICATION
byron DON JUAN
byron Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,
byron Damm'd from its fountain--the child from the knee
byron Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,
byron Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.
byron Dancing all free and happy in the sun),
byron Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;
byron Dante and Milton, and of both the affection
byron Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
byron Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!
byron Dash into poetry, which is but passion,
byron Dash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.
byron Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers
byron Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,
byron Day has not broke--there 's no one in the street:
byron Days better drawn before, or else assume
byron Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill--
byron Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,
byron Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.
byron Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real
byron Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'
byron Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe
byron Dear as her father had been to Haidee,
byron Dear is the helpless creature we defend
byron Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,
byron Death 's a reformer, all men must allow.
byron Death laughs at all you weep for:--look upon
byron Death laughs--Go ponder o'er the skeleton
byron Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
byron Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
byron Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;
byron Death, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,
byron Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;
byron December's drowsy day to his dull race,--
byron Decide, and every body one day will
byron Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;
byron Deck'd by the rays reflected from his host,
byron Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,
byron Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
byron Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
byron Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide--
byron Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;
byron Deepest attraction; for when to the view
byron Deepest in those who long the most to die.
byron Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;
byron Defended at a price extremely dear.
byron Degenerate into hands like mine?
byron Delighted with their dinner and their host,
byron Denying several little things he wanted:
byron Denying the receipt of what it cost,
byron Departed like the rest of their compeers,
byron Dependent on the public altogether;
byron Depending more upon the historian's style
byron Depends so much upon the gastric juice?
byron Descend--the fault is mine; this fatal shore
byron Descending rather quickly the declivity,
byron Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
byron Described--what 's strange--in words extremely few:
byron Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?
byron Description; and I won't reflect,--that is,
byron Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
byron Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated
byron Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
byron Despatching single cruisers here and there,
byron Despite her injured love and fiery pride;
byron Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
byron Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.
byron Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;
byron Detachment of three columns took its station,
byron Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,
byron Devour'd it, longing for the other too.
byron Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
byron Did not his deeds unriddle them each day--
byron Differ, except in robbing with a bow,
byron Dine with them on his pastor and his master.
byron Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,
byron Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
byron Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
byron Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,
byron Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye
byron Discover stars and sail in the wind's eye,
byron Discoveries made, but none could be aware
byron Discretion, and were not so peaceable
byron Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,
byron Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;
byron Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
byron Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams
byron Display'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;
byron Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
byron Dissecting the whole inside of a question,
byron Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.
byron Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.
byron Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
byron Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals
byron Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.
byron Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--
byron Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.
byron Does these things for us, and whenever newly
byron Dogs, or men!--for I flatter you in saying
byron Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd--why,
byron Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
byron Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
byron Don Juan at his hands, and information
byron Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
byron Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian--
byron Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;
byron Don Juan in his feminine disguise,
byron Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as
byron Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,
byron Don Juan raised his little captive from
byron Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,
byron Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
byron Don Juan was delighted to secure
byron Don Juan was presented, and his dress
byron Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
byron Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;
byron Don Juan, having done the best he could
byron Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
byron Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,
byron Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who
byron Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows
byron Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,
byron Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,
byron Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,--
byron Done anything exceedingly unkind,--
byron Done thine, the present vouches for the past.
byron Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure
byron Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
byron Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;
byron Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,
byron Down her white neck long floating auburn curls
byron Down to a very homely household savour.
byron Down to the harp--because to music's charms
byron Drains its first draught of lips:--but, as I said,
byron Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;
byron Dreading that climax of all human ills,
byron Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
byron Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;
byron Drest to receive so much good company.
byron Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;
byron Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess
byron Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,
byron Drew himself up to his full height again,
byron Drew quiet consolation through its hint,
byron Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,
byron Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,
byron Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
byron Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--
byron Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.
byron Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,
byron Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside
byron Dudu was fond of kissing--which I 'm sure
byron Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,
byron Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,
byron Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:
byron During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
byron Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,
byron Dyes with his morning light,--and would conceal
byron Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
byron E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;
byron Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
byron Each bevy with the merchant in his station:
byron Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.
byron Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
byron Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
byron Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
byron Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,
byron Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.
byron Each other; and if not, I shall not try
byron Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,
byron Each pulse to animation, till beneath
byron Each rose up at his own, and had to spare
byron Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen
byron Each was an angel, and earth paradise.
byron Each was the other's mirror, and but read

byron Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.
byron Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!
byron Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace

byron Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
byron Had not come up in time to cast an awe
byron Had not one word to say of constancy.
byron Had not so many ornaments to strike,
byron Had often turn'd the art to some account:
byron Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder
byron Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:
byron Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
byron Had raised an interest in her, which increased.
byron Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;
byron Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,
byron Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,
byron Had seen the world--which is a curious sight,
byron Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,
byron Had sent them this for their deliverance.
byron Had set some time, and night was on the ridge

byron Hark! rising to the ignoble call--

byron Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.
byron Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.

byron Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--
byron Hate to the world and war with every nation
byron Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,
byron Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:
byron Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.
byron Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;
byron Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;

byron Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
byron Have always had a tendency to spare,--
byron Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native
byron Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,

byron Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.
byron Have left undone the greatest--and mankind.
byron Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,

byron Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole
byron Have princes who spur more than their postilions.
byron Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.
byron Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;
byron Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,--
byron Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
byron Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
byron Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?
byron Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
byron Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are
byron Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
byron Have taken up at length with younger brothers:
byron Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
byron Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.
byron Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.
byron Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
byron Having been several days in great distress,
byron Having been used to serve on horses' backs,
byron Having no custom-house nor quarantine
byron Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
byron Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'
byron Having no paper, for the want of better,
byron Having withstood temptation in my youth,
byron Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;
byron He 'll answer all for better or for worse,
byron He 's a fine boy. The women may be sent
byron He 's wrong--unless man were a pig, indeed,
byron He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires
byron He almost honour'd him for his docility;
byron He also found that he had lost his dinner.
byron He also had a quality uncommon
byron He also had been busy seeing sights--
byron He also stuff'd his money where he could
byron He always is complaining of his lot,
byron He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--
byron He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded
byron He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
byron He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,
byron He being paid to satirize or flatter,
byron He bore these sneers against his near relations,
byron He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
byron He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
byron He but requested to be bled to death:
byron He caged in one huge hamper altogether.
byron He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
byron He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;
byron He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
byron He chose himself to point out what he thought
byron He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
byron He climb'd to where the parapet appears;
byron He could not help the thing which he related:
byron He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,
byron He counted them at break of day--
byron He danced without theatrical pretence,
byron He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,
byron He deems it is his proper place to be;
byron He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
byron He did not fall asleep just after dinner;
byron He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
byron He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,
byron He did not take such studies for restraints;
byron He did not think much on the matter, nor
byron He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
byron He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
byron He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on
byron He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
byron He died, deserving well his country's tears,
byron He died: and most unluckily, because,
byron He doubted not a few hours of reflection
byron He drank six cups of coffee at the least,
byron He enter'd in the house no more his home,
byron He enter'd in the house--his home no more,
byron He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,
byron He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
byron He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like
byron He fell, immortal in a bulletin.
byron He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
byron He felt like other plants called sensitive,
byron He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
byron He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
byron He flew into a passion, and in fact
byron He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
byron He fought, but has not fed so well of late.
byron He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd
byron He found himself alone, and friends retiring.
byron He found himself extremely in the fashion,
byron He found how much old Time had been a winner--
byron He found--but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
byron He from the world had cut off a great man,
byron He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.
byron He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
byron He gave the different nations something national;
byron He gave the word,--'Arrest or slay the Frank.'
byron He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
byron He glanced like a personified Bolero;
byron He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
byron He had a kind of inclination, or
byron He had also stood at times behind the throne--
byron He had an English look; that is, was square
byron He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,
byron He had been hid--I don't pretend to say
byron He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.
byron He had behaved with courage and humanity--
byron He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,--
byron He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,
byron He had his judge's joke for consolation.
byron He had many friends who had many wives, and was
byron He had no business to commit a sin,
byron He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.
byron He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.
byron He had pronounced her name--but she forgot
byron He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,
byron He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,
byron He hated cruelty, as all men hate
byron He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark
byron He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
byron He heard repeated, Juan with a frown
byron He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,
byron He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
byron He hew'd away, like doctors of theology
byron He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure
byron He is your only poet;--passion, pure
byron He is, nor whence he came--and little care;
byron He judged them proper to assail the works;
byron He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,
byron He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.
byron He knew not why, arriving at this pass,
byron He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
byron He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
byron He knew the world, and would not see depravity
byron He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;
byron He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,
byron He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
byron He led them onward, first through a low thicket
byron He left his ship to be hove down next day,
byron He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
byron He left to his vizier all state affairs,
byron He lied with such a fervour of intention--
byron He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;
byron He liked to have a handsome paramour
byron He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
byron He likewise could be most things to all women,
byron He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry
byron He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
byron He loved the infant orphan he had saved,
byron He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide
byron He made no answer; but he took the city.
byron He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it
byron He may resume his amatory care
byron He might be taught, by love and her together--
byron He might--and brought them up with skill, in time
byron He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
byron He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,
byron He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
byron He must his laurels separately earn;
byron He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)
byron He naturally loved what he protected:
byron He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;--
byron He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.
byron He never would believe the city won
byron He owed to an old woman and his post.
byron He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;
byron He paused, and took a survey up and down.
byron He paused--and so will I; as doth a crew
byron He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
byron He praised the present, and abused the past,
byron He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'
byron He puzzled over what he found a new one,
byron He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
byron He recognised an officer of rank.
byron He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse
byron He rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken
byron He said,--and in the kindest Calmuck tone,--
byron He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
byron He saw increasing on his father's heart,
byron He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd
byron He saw ten thousand living authors pass,
byron He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
byron He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,
byron He saw, however, at the closing session,
byron He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource
byron He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
byron He seem'd to sleep,--for you could scarcely tell
byron He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,
byron He served--but served Polycrates--
byron He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
byron He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise
byron He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.
byron He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.
byron He show'd them how to mount a ladder (which
byron He shows more appetite for words than war.
byron He shut his door, and after having read
byron He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said
byron He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd
byron He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
byron He still preferr'd his own neck to another's.
byron He still was in the boat and had but dozed,
byron He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
byron He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
byron He stood like Atlas, with a world of words
byron He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.
byron He stopp'd.--What singular emotions fill
byron He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
byron He studied steadily, and grew apace,
byron He stumbled on, to try if he could find
byron He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,
byron He that reserves his laurels for posterity
byron He there builds up a formidable dyke
byron He thought about himself, and the whole earth
byron He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
byron He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
byron He took to regularly peopling Earth,
byron He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
byron He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
byron He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
byron He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise--
byron He varied with some skill his adulations;
byron He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.
byron He walks from hall to hall.
byron He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
byron He was a bachelor, which is a matter
byron He was a cold, good, honourable man,
byron He was a jolly fellow, and could crack
byron He was a man of a strange temperament,
byron He was a man who had seen many changes,
byron He was a mortal of the careless kind,
byron He was above the vulgar by his mien;
byron He was as good a sovereign of the sort
byron He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
byron He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,
byron He was not all alone: around him grew
byron He was not yet quite old enough to prove
byron He was now growing up like a green tree, able
byron He was so great a loss to good society.
byron He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
byron He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how
byron He was what Erin calls, in her sublime
byron He watch'd it wistfully, until away
byron He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,
byron He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers
byron He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,
byron He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
byron He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,
byron He who sleeps best may be the most content.
byron He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
byron He will forgive himself;--if not, I must.
byron He will forgive us--yes--it must be--yes.
byron He wish'd that land he never might see more;
byron He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps--
byron He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'
byron He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
byron He won them well, and may he wear them long!
byron He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.
byron He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
byron He would have written sonnets all his life?
byron He would not justify what he had done,
byron He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,
byron He wrote to Spain:--and all his near relations,
byron He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
byron He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
byron He, on the other hand, if not in love,
byron He--being a man who seldom used a word
byron Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,
byron Heard,--and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum
byron Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:
byron Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckon'd;
byron Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,
byron Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.
byron Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes
byron Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.
byron Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,
byron Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,
byron Held out unto the hungry Israelites;
byron Help contradicting them, and every body,
byron Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
byron Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning--
byron Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:
byron Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,
byron Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess
byron Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,
byron Her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through--
byron Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
byron Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog
byron Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
byron Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:
byron Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
byron Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,
byron Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
byron Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
byron Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
byron Her charming figure and romantic history
byron Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
byron Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
byron Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,
byron Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
byron Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
byron Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
byron Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd
byron Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:
byron Her conduct had been perfectly correct,
byron Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,
byron Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
byron Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
byron Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;
byron Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
byron Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
byron Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
byron Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
byron Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.
byron Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
byron Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
byron Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
byron Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
byron Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.
byron Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
byron Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,
byron Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
byron Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.
byron Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;
byron Her father's blood before her father's face
byron Her father's face--but never stopp'd his hand.
byron Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,
byron Her favourite science was the mathematical,
byron Her features all the sweetness of the devil,
byron Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
byron Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;
byron Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;
byron Her form had all the softness of her sex,
byron Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;
byron Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,
byron Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.
byron Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:
byron Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
byron Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,
byron Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung
byron Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
byron Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.
byron Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
byron Her hair had silver only, bound to be
byron Her hair was dripping, and the very balls
byron Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold
byron Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
byron Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
byron Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
byron Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes
byron Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;
byron Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping
byron Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
byron Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
byron Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,
byron Her human day is kindled; full of power
byron Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
byron Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,
byron Her inward grace for outward show, and makes
byron Her late performance had been a dead set
byron Her letter out again, and read it through.)
byron Her life to chance; but point me out some nook
byron Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
byron Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
byron Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
byron Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
byron Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up--
byron Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
byron Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
byron Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
byron Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,
byron Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again
byron Her neck alone was seen, but that was found
byron Her next amusement was more fanciful;
byron Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
byron Her note, she don't forget the infant girl
byron Her office was to keep aloof or smother
byron Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd
byron Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
byron Her person if allow'd at large to run,
byron Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
byron Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
byron Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
byron Her presence was as lofty as her state;
byron Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
byron Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well--
byron Her reason being weak, her passions strong,
byron Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream
byron Her resolutions were most truly great,
byron Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
byron Her second, to cut only his--acquaintance;
byron Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
byron Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:
byron Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence
byron Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.
byron Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
byron Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
byron Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend
byron Her speech out to her protege and friend,
byron Her state (it is the custom of her nation),
byron Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.
byron Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):
byron Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
byron Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
byron Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,
byron Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
byron Her talents were of the more silent class;
byron Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,
byron Her third was feminine enough to annul
byron Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;
byron Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;
byron Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
byron Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.
byron Her throne and power, and every thing beside.
byron Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'
byron Her toilet, which cost little, for she was
byron Her very nod was not an inclination;
byron Her very place of birth was but a spectre
byron Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
byron Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
byron Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb--
byron Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,
byron Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,
byron Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
byron Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.
byron Her young philosopher was grown already.
byron Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
byron Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?
byron Here I might enter on a chaste description,
byron Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
byron Here Lolah interposed--'Mamma, you know
byron Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
byron Here War forgot his own destructive art
byron Here and there studded with a seventy-four;
byron Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone
byron Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,
byron Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail
byron Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
byron Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!
byron Here laws are all inviolate; none lay
byron Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--
byron Here pause we for the present--as even then
byron Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it
byron Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;
byron Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;
byron Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'
byron Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction
byron Here their conductor tapping at the wicket
byron Here they were interrupted by a humming
byron Here was an honourable compromise,
byron Here was no lack of innocent diversion
byron Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
byron Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,
byron Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,
byron Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is
byron Heroes sometimes, though seldom--sages never;
byron Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,
byron Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,
byron Herself from out her present jeopardy,
byron Herself in her sublimest attitude:
byron Herself that her intentions were the best,
byron Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.
byron Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,
byron High and inscrutable the old man stood,
byron High barrows, without marble or a name,
byron High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,
byron High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:
byron Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
byron Him borne into the house and up the stair,
byron Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
byron Him up to learn his catechism alone,
byron Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell
byron Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways
byron Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown--
byron Himself a favourite, ventured to address
byron Himself and Juan in their mutual stations
byron Himself at length within the leafy nooks
byron Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,
byron Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?
byron Himself in at the age when all grow good;
byron Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:
byron Hint that some six or seven good years ago
byron Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.
byron Hinted the vast advantages which they
byron His Grace was an enduring, married man,
byron His Highness cast around his great black eyes,
byron His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,
byron His Highness was a man of solemn port,
byron His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,--
byron His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
byron His Spanish friends for those in Italy.
byron His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,
byron His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
byron His answers with a very graceful bow,
byron His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
byron His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
byron His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,
byron His bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish
byron His berth a little damp, and him afraid.
byron His best to obey in what he had been task'd;
byron His bills in, and however we may storm,
byron His blood less noble than such blood should be;
byron His blood was running on the very floor
byron His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
byron His bosom,--for he never had a sister:
byron His bow converted into a cock'd hat;
byron His brain about the action of the sky;
byron His breath,--he from his swelling throat untied
byron His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
byron His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.
byron His cap and head, which proves the head to be
byron His cause by leaning much from might to right:
byron His classic studies made a little puzzle,
byron His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
byron His country's wrongs and his despair to save her
byron His daily council upon ways and means
byron His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
byron His daughter--had not sent before to advise
byron His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,
byron His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
byron His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;
byron His duties warlike, loving or official,
byron His empire also was without a bound:
byron His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
byron His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,
byron His fame too,--for he had that kind of fame
byron His father's name was Jose--Don, of course,--
byron His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
byron His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
byron His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,
byron His figure, and the splendour of his dress,
byron His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
byron His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.
byron His five brave boys no less the foe defied;
byron His form you may trace, but not his face,
byron His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,
byron His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,
byron His garden trees all shadowy and green;
byron His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
byron His garments only a slight murmur made;
byron His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
byron His glory might half equal his estate.
byron His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
byron His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
byron His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,
byron His head upon his elbow, and he saw
byron His head, until the ceremony ended.
byron His headache being increased by every billow;
byron His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
byron His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
byron His holy temples in the lands which bred
byron His home deserted for the lonely wood,
byron His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;
byron His house was sold, his servants sent away,
byron His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,
byron His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
byron His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
byron His lady--mother, mathematical,
byron His last award, will have the long grass grow
byron His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;
byron His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,
byron His little captive gain'd him some applause
byron His majesty saluted his fourth spouse
byron His majesty was always so polite
byron His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,
byron His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;
byron His maxims, which to martial comprehension
byron His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
byron His morns he pass'd in business--which, dissected,
byron His mother was a learned lady, famed
byron His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
byron His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
byron His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
byron His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight
byron His only shrine of feelings undefiled.
byron His orders, also to receive his pensions,
byron His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!
byron His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'
byron His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,
byron His own remonstrance further he well knew
byron His own shall roll before you like a ball!'
byron His own well in; so well, ere you could look,
byron His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
byron His parts of speech; and in the strange displays
byron His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed
byron His peace was making, but before he ventured
byron His pockets first and then his body riddled.
byron His polar star being one which rather ranges,
byron His port lay on the other side o' the isle.
byron His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:
byron His predecessors in the Colchian days;
byron His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians
byron His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved
byron His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
byron His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
byron His qualities (with them) into sublime:
byron His question, much too merry to divine
byron His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
byron His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
byron His second son was levell'd by a shot;
byron His self-communion with his own high soul,
byron His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,
byron His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
byron His singing I no further trust can place in:
byron His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
byron His smile, requested one of them to tell
byron His sober head, majestically tame,
byron His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
byron His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
byron His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)
byron His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
byron His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,
byron His station, generation, even his nation,
byron His steady application as a dancer,
byron His stern philosophy; but gently stroking
byron His strain display'd some feeling--right or wrong;
byron His stubborn valour was no future shield.
byron His suffocation by that pretty pair;
byron His suite consisted of three servants and
byron His sympathy for rank, by the same token,
byron His temper not being under great command,
byron His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,
byron His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd
byron His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:
byron His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
byron His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
byron His travels to the capital apace;--
byron His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,
byron His verses rarely wanted their due feet;
byron His very cellars might be kings' abodes;
byron His way to--where he knew not--single handed;
byron His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,
byron His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
byron His wondrous journey to some foreign court,
byron His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
byron His youth and constitution bore him through,
byron His youth and features favour'd the disguise,
byron His youth was not the chastest that might be,
byron His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
byron Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put
byron History can only take things in the gross;
byron Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
byron Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
byron Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
byron Honour was more before their names than after;
byron Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.
byron Hoping no very old vizier might choose,
byron Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,
byron Horatian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'
byron Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,
byron Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;
byron Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.
byron Houris, or aught except his florid race
byron How I have treated it, I do not know;
byron How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
byron How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.
byron How all the nations deem her their worst foe,
byron How all the needy honourable misters,
byron How answers each bold Bacchanal!
byron How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests
byron How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
byron How beautiful that moment! and how odd is
byron How can you do such things and keep your fame,
byron How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!
byron How dare you think your lady would go on so?
byron How eager all the earth is for the blow
byron How earth could round the solar orbit run,
byron How far it profits is another matter.-
byron How get out? how the devil got we in?
byron How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!
byron How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:
byron How like they look'd! the expression was the same;
byron How lonely every freeborn creature broods!
byron How long in his damp trance young Juan lay
byron How many miles the moon might have in girth,
byron How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;
byron How much I have loved--that I love not thee!
byron How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
byron How our villeggiatura will get on.
byron How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!
byron How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
byron How power could condescend to do without.
byron How self-deceitful is the sagest part
byron How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?-
byron How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque
byron How should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?
byron How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
byron How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,
byron How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!
byron How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!
byron How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!
byron How the new worldlings of the then new East
byron How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
byron How this same interview had taken place,
byron How to accept a better in his turn.
byron How to encounter with this martial scold,
byron How we won't mention, why we need not say:
byron How will--to these young people, just thrust out
byron How, nor can I indeed describe the where--
byron Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:
byron Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command
byron Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,
byron However dear or cherish'd in their day;
byron However disciplined and debonnaire:--
byron However little both are understood
byron However strange, he could not yet forget her,
byron However they might savour of delirious;
byron However this may be, 't is pretty sure
byron However this might be, the race went on
byron However, 't is expedient to be wary:
byron However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels
byron However, I forgive him, and I trust
byron However, he did pretty well, and was
byron However, he replied at hazard, with
byron However, present remedy was none,
byron However, the poor jackals are less foul
byron Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd
byron Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:
byron Humanity must yield to steel and flame:
byron Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'
byron Humboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not
byron Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore
byron Hurra! and Allah! and--one moment more,
byron Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!
byron Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,
byron Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
byron Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection
byron I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,
byron I 'd rather not say what might be related
byron I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word
byron I 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,
byron I 'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,
byron I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
byron I 'll have another figure in a trice:--
byron I 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,
byron I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:
byron I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;
byron I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is
byron I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair
byron I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
byron I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
byron I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--
byron I 'll write poetical commandments, which
byron I 'm 'at my old lunes'--digression, and forget
byron I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!
byron I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,
byron I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.
byron I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
byron I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
byron I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
byron I 'm not to blame, as you well know--no more is
byron I 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'
byron I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
byron I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
byron I 'm serious--so are all men upon paper;
byron I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.
byron I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
byron I 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,
byron I 've bribed my grandmother's review--the British.
byron I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,
byron I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;
byron I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate
byron I 've got new mythological machinery,
byron I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl
byron I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,
byron I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd
byron I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.
byron I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.
byron I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,
byron I 've not begun what we have to go through.
byron I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.
byron I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.
byron I 've said all I know of a name that fills
byron I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
byron I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
byron I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
byron I 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,
byron I 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,
byron I almost lately have begun to doubt
byron I also would suggest the fitting time
byron I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
byron I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,
byron I am no flatterer--you 've supp'd full of flattery:
byron I am not dazzled by this splendid roof,
byron I am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'
byron I ask in turn,--Why do you play at cards?
byron I by and by may tell you, if at all:
byron I call such things transmission; for there is
byron I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown
byron I can't but say it is an awkward sight
byron I can't but say it seems to me most truly
byron I can't but say that his mamma was right,
byron I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,
byron I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
byron I can't exactly trace their rule of right,
byron I can't help putting in my claim to praise--
byron I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
byron I can't help thinking puberty assisted.
byron I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;
byron I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
byron I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
byron I can't say that she gave them any tea,
byron I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
byron I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
byron I can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound
byron I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
byron I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,--
byron I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
byron I cannot stop to alter words once written,
byron I cannot tell exactly what it was;
byron I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,
byron I canter by the spot each afternoon
byron I care not for new pleasures, as the old
byron I care not--'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'
byron I cast thee on the waters--go thy ways!
byron I chose a modern subject as more meet.
byron I comprehend, for without transformation
byron I could not deem myself a slave.
byron I could say more, but do not choose to encroach
byron I could send forth my mandate like a primate
byron I cried upon my first wife's dying day,
byron I do declare, upon an affidavit,
byron I do not know you, and may never know
byron I do not know;--I wish men to be free
byron I do not mean destruction and exposure,
byron I don't choose to say much upon this head,
byron I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:
byron I don't know how the thing occurr'd--it might
byron I don't know that there may be much ability
byron I don't know what the reason is--the air
byron I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell--
byron I don't know whether they had arms or crest,
byron I don't know which was more admired or less:
byron I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite
byron I don't mean this as general, but particular
byron I don't mean to reflect--a man so great as
byron I don't much like describing people mad,
byron I don't pretend that I quite understand
byron I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
byron I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well
byron I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.
byron I doubt if any now could make it worse
byron I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.
byron I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
byron I favor'd none--nay, was almost uncivil?
byron I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.
byron I feel a mix'd regret and veneration
byron I feel my heart become so sympathetic,
byron I for one venerate a petticoat--
byron I found the military commandant
byron I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;
byron I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,
byron I grant you in a church 't is very well:
byron I had forgotten--but must not forget--
byron I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
byron I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
byron I hardly could compose another line:
byron I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle
byron I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,
byron I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,
byron I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,
byron I hate your poets, so read none of those.
byron I have a passion for the name of 'Mary,'
byron I have always liked you better than I state:
byron I have answer'd all your questions without pressing,
byron I have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,
byron I have examined few pair of that hue);
byron I have forgotten what I meant to say,
byron I have named a few, not foremost in degree,
byron I have no authority to tell the reason.'
byron I have no further claim on your young heart,
byron I have no more time nor many words to spare.'
byron I have sat up on purpose all the night,
byron I have seen Joanna Southcote--I have seen--
byron I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,
byron I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean--
byron I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap--
byron I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-
byron I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to
byron I have seen more than I 'll say:--but we will see
byron I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and
byron I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses
byron I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen--
byron I have seen the Landholders without a rap--
byron I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers--
byron I have seen the funds at war with house and land--
byron I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand
byron I have tried both; so those who would a part take
byron I heard a shot--'t was eight o'clock scarce past--
byron I heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;--
byron I hope he 's young and handsome--is he tall?
byron I hope this little question is no sin,
byron I knew his father well, and have some skill
byron I knew one woman of that purple school,
byron I knew that nought was lasting, but now even
byron I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;
byron I know its mighty empire now allures
byron I know no other reason, whatsoe'er
byron I know not how, but good as any other;
byron I know not if he had domestic cares--
byron I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
byron I know not what might be the lady's thought,
byron I know not who may conquer: if I could
byron I know not why, but in that hour to-night,
byron I know not, never counting past their teens;
byron I know not--it succeeded, and success
byron I know that some would fain postpone this era,
byron I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'
byron I learn'd the little that I know by this:
byron I leave Don Juan for the present, safe--
byron I leave it to your people of sagacity
byron I leave the saints to settle their own score.
byron I leave them for the present with good wishes,
byron I leave you to your conscience as before,
byron I left Don Juan with his horses baiting--
byron I like to be particular in dates,
byron I loathe that low vice--curiosity;
byron I look for it--'t is gone, a globe of glass!
byron I love him--I will die with him: I knew
byron I love the mystery of a female missal,
byron I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse
byron I make a resolution every spring
byron I may ensure the public, and defy
byron I mean the seraph way of those above.
byron I mean to show things really as they are,
byron I mean, that every age and every year,
byron I meant to make this poem very short,
byron I might describe, as I have seen it all,
byron I mourn, but for the past;--I loved a maid:'-
byron I must not quite omit the talking sage,
byron I must, although a favourite 'plat' of mine
byron I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal
byron I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was
byron I never know the word which will come next.
byron I never married--but, I think, I know
byron I never saw such eyes--but hark! now choose
byron I never think about it in a heat),
byron I now mean to be serious;--it is time,
byron I once had great alacrity in wielding
byron I only say suppose it--inter nos.
byron I only say suppose this supposition:
byron I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;
byron I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:
byron I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,
byron I perch upon an humbler promontory,
byron I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
byron I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,
byron I quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,
byron I quite forget which of them was in hand
byron I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,
byron I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'
byron I rather think the moon should date the dears.
byron I rattle on exactly as I 'd talk
byron I really don't know what, nor Julia either.
byron I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal
byron I really, madam, wonder at your taste
byron I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.
byron I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,
byron I recollect some innkeepers who don't
byron I recommend as much to every wife.
byron I recommend young ladies to make trial.
byron I said before: the frugal life is his,
byron I said that Juan did not think them pretty
byron I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--
byron I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about--
byron I said that Lambro was a man of patience,
byron I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
byron I said they were alike, their features and
byron I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
byron I say a thing, it must at once be done.
byron I say at first--for he found out at last,
byron I say no more than hath been said in Dante's
byron I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking
byron I say that line 's a lapsus of the pen;--
byron I say that there 's the place--but 'Verbum sat.'
byron I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,
byron I say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'
byron I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth
byron I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
byron I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,
byron I see their glorious black eyes shine;
byron I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
byron I shall have much to speak about), and she
byron I shall not be particular in stating
byron I shall not say exactly what he said,
byron I shall offend all parties: never mind!
byron I shall perpend if your proposal may
byron I shall proceed with his adventures is
byron I should be glad to know that which is being?
byron I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,
byron I sing them both, and am about to batter
byron I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:
byron I spare you then the furniture and plate.
byron I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
byron I study, also Blair, the highest reachers
byron I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
byron I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare
byron I therefore deal in generalities.
byron I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,
byron I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,
byron I think I can explain myself without
byron I think I hear a little bird, who sings
byron I think I know a trick or two, would turn
byron I think I must take up with avarice.
byron I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
byron I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
byron I think it may be of 'Corinthian Brass,'
byron I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in
byron I think that 'Philo-genitiveness' is
byron I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
byron I think that several volumes would fall short,
byron I think that were I certain of success,
byron I think that with this holy new alliance
byron I think the foolish people were possess'd,
byron I think to canter gently through a hundred.
byron I think too that I have sate up too late:
byron I think with Alexander, that the act
byron I think you 'll find from many a family picture,
byron I thought of a peruke the other day)--
byron I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.
byron I thought, at setting off, about two dozen
byron I touch a single leaf where he is warden;--
byron I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--
byron I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain
byron I want a hero: an uncommon want,
byron I was most ready to return a blow,
byron I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,
byron I will not make his great description less,
byron I wish he would explain his explanation.
byron I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
byron I wish it never led to something worse.
byron I wish the case could come before a jury here.
byron I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,
byron I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
byron I wish they knew the life of a young noble.
byron I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,
byron I wish to do as much by poesy.
byron I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!
byron I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
byron I wish you a good appetite.'--'Farewell!'
byron I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,
byron I won't be bail for anything beyond.
byron I won't describe,--that is, if I can help
byron I won't describe; description is my forte,
byron I won't philosophise, and will be read.
byron I wonder if his appetite was good?
byron I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
byron I wonder people should be left alive;
byron I would not be a tortoise in his screen
byron I would not imitate the petty thought,
byron I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--
byron I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack
byron I write what 's uppermost, without delay:
byron I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
byron I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm
byron I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
byron I, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,
byron If 'courts' and 'camps' be quite so sentimental.
byron If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,
byron If 'tis summ'd up with feminine precision,
byron If Antony be well remember'd yet,
byron If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,
byron If Homer had found mortars ready made;
byron If I agree that what is, is; then this I call
byron If I can stave off thought, which--as a whelp
byron If I could yield you any consolation,
byron If I had not perceived that revolution
byron If I have any fault, it is digression--
byron If I might augur, I should rate but low
byron If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,
byron If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder
byron If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs
byron If all the dead could now return to life
byron If all these seem a heterogeneous mas
byron If all things be consider'd: first, there was
byron If any laughter at such times could be,
byron If any person doubt it, I appeal
byron If any person should presume to assert
byron If any said so, for to be precocious
byron If any take me for that which I seem:
byron If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
byron If but to keep thy credit as a mower.
byron If but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,
byron If cause should be--a lioness, though tame.
byron If ever I should condescend to prose,
byron If ever you indeed deserved the name,
byron If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,
byron If fallen in evil days on evil tongues,
byron If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,
byron If free from passion, which all friendship checks,
byron If from great nature's or our own abyss
byron If he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,

byron If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
byron If matters had been managed as desired,

byron If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,--
byron If stars and titles could entail long praise,
byron If such an education was the true one.
byron If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:

byron If that can well be, than his wooden look.
byron If that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,

byron If they would condescend to circumcision.
byron If this be the right reading--'t is no matter;
byron If this be true; for we must deem the mode
byron If true, 'tis no great lease of its own fire;
byron If we may judge of matter by the mind,
byron If we should strike a stroke to set us free;
byron If yet the city's rest were won or lost;
byron If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,

byron In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on
byron In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:
byron In Guido's famous fresco which alone
byron In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,
byron In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd
byron In Marinet's affair--in fact, 't was shabby,
byron In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
byron In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd
byron In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on
byron In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
byron In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories
byron In a few words he told their hapless story,
byron In a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.
byron In a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'
byron In a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing.'
byron In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;
byron In all the circumstances of the case,
byron In all the flashing of their full array;
byron In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.
byron In all their habits;--not so you, I own;
byron In all these he was much and deeply read;
byron In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:
byron In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter
byron In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,
byron In answer made an inclination to

byron In balancing the profit and the loss,
byron In begging him, for God's sake, just to show
byron In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,
byron In braids behind; and though her stature were

byron In case he thought his wife too great a prize.
byron In case of any premature disclosure;
byron In case our lord the king should go to war again,
byron In character--but it would not be fair
byron In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill
byron In chronological commemoration,
byron In cities caged. The present case in point I
byron In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,
byron In company a very pleasant fellow,
byron In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's
byron In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,
byron In courtesy their wish to see display'd
byron In currents through the calmer water spread
byron In darkness--I can only hope they did.
byron In decent London when the daylight 's o'er;
byron In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,
byron In digging the foundation of a closet,
byron In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt
byron In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;--
byron In every Christian language ever named,
byron In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.
byron In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,
byron In fact they can be safe. You should have been

byron Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,
byron Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper
byron Juan, who did not stand in the predicament
byron Juan, who did not understand a word
byron Juan, who for an instant had been moved
byron Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,

byron Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,
byron Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd
byron Just for the present; and in his lull'd head

byron Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
byron Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.
byron Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
byron Kept the place open for their emulation.
byron Kept this herself, and gave her son another.
byron Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.
byron Kept up; and above all, the where and how
byron Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.
byron Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
byron Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.
byron Kindness, destroys what little we had got:
byron Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,

byron Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,
byron Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,

byron Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
byron Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
byron Knowing they must be settled by the laws.
byron Knowledge of matters--but no matter what--
byron Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,

byron Like one who grapples with his enemy,
byron Like other angry ladies of her nation,--
byron Like other men, too, may have had my passion--
byron Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,

byron Like small stars through the milky way apparent;
byron Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
byron Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,
byron Like that same mystic music of the spheres,
byron Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;

byron Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;
byron Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,
byron Love bears within its breast the very germ
byron Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
byron Love is so very timid when 't is new:
byron Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive;

byron March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

byron Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,

byron Perhaps this new position--but I 'm right;
byron Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
byron Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,

byron Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,
byron Perhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,
byron Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,
byron Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,
byron Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
byron Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

byron She also had no passion for confession;
byron She and her maid--and promised by daybreak
byron She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
byron She being wiser by a year or two:
byron She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
byron She call'd her husband now and then apart,
byron She came into the cave, but it was merely
byron She cannot do these things, nor one or two
byron She cannot step as does an Arab barb,
byron She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
byron She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part
byron She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
byron She could not find at first a fit successor.
byron She could not from the spot, and the loud roar
byron She could repay each amatory look you lent
byron She deem'd her least command must yield delight,
byron She did not even look into the mirror.
byron She did not find herself the least disposed
byron She did not run away, too,--did she, sir?'
byron She did this during even her husband's life--
byron She died, but not alone; she held within
byron She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood--
byron She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,
byron She drew out her provision from the basket.
byron She drew up to her height, as if to show
byron She fell with Buonaparte--What strange thoughts
byron She felt it going, and resolved to make
byron She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
byron She gathers a repertory of facts,
byron She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
byron She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;
byron She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
byron She had a curious crew as well as cargo,
byron She had a good opinion of advice,
byron She had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage
byron She had consented to create again
byron She had no need of this, day ne'er will break
byron She had no prudence, but he had; and this
byron She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;
byron She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,
byron She had resolved that he should travel through
byron She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.
byron She had some other motive much more near
byron She hardly knew, to such perfection brings
byron She has served me also much the same as you,
byron She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:
byron She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.
byron She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
byron She keeps it for you like a true ally.
byron She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
byron She kept her counsel in so close a way.
byron She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
byron She knew the Latin--that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
byron She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
byron She liked quick answers in all conversations;
byron She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
byron She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
byron She look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut
byron She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
byron She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,
byron She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale
byron She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love
byron She loved, and was beloved--she adored,
byron She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
byron She made the earth below seem holy ground.
byron She married (I forget the pedigree)
byron She merely felt a common sympathy
byron She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,
byron She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
byron She never thought about herself at all.
byron She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
byron She next decided he was only bad;
byron She now determined that a virtuous woman
byron She order'd him directly to be bought,
byron She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
byron She promised never more to have a dream,
byron She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
byron She put all coronets into commotion:
byron She read some French romances here and there,
byron She recognized no being, and no spot,
byron She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw
byron She sate, but not alone; I know not well
byron She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
byron She saw them watch her without asking why,
byron She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
byron She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
byron She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon
byron She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.
byron She show'd a great dislike to holy water:
byron She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem
byron She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
byron She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
byron She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
byron She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,
byron She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.
byron She spake some words to her attendants, who
byron She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.
byron She stood a moment as a Pythones
byron She stood as one who champion'd human fears--
byron She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak--but paused,
byron She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,
byron She then prefers him in the plural number,
byron She then resolved to send him on a mission,
byron She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'
byron She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
byron She thought of killing Juan--but, poor lad!
byron She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)
byron She thought to stab herself, but then she had
byron She thought with some simplicity indeed;
byron She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,
byron She took Juanna by the hand to show
byron She took his lady also in affection,
byron She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort
byron She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
byron She waited on her lady with the sun,
byron She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,
byron She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,
byron She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.
byron She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).
byron She was all which pure ignorance allows,
byron She was as capable as woman can be.
byron She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,
byron She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
byron She was not violently lively, but
byron She was of course the favorite of the four.
byron She was so like a vision; I might err,
byron She was the mild reprover of the young,
byron She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.
byron She was, or thought she was, his friend--and this
byron She whisper'd, in great wrath--'I must deposit
byron She who for many years had watch'd her son so--
byron She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
byron She wonder'd at herself how she could scream--
byron She wore two jelicks--one was of pale yellow;
byron She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
byron She would revoke the order he had heard.
byron She, for the future of her strength convinced.
byron She, too, was fortunate last carnival,
byron Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd
byron Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
byron Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.
byron Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
byron Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
byron Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,
byron Short solace, vain relief!--thought came too quick,
byron Short speeches pass between two men who speak
byron Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh
byron Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
byron Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
byron Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
byron Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
byron Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
byron Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.
byron Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.
byron Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.
byron Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize
byron Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley.
byron Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
byron Should rather face and overcome temptation,
byron Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death
byron Should so continue--'t is a point of honour;
byron Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
byron Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,
byron Show what the passions are in their full growth.
byron Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through
byron Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,
byron Show'd what things were before the world was free!
byron Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
byron Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,
byron Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--
byron Shows stars and women in a better light.
byron Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.
byron Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke
byron Shrinks from the application of hot towels,
byron Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
byron Shut up each high heroic salamander,
byron Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!
byron Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;
byron Shut up--no, not the King, but the Pavilion,

byron The servants all were getting drunk or idling,

byron The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
byron The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'
byron The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,

byron The shudder which runs naturally through
byron The sights he was accustom'd to behold,
byron The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun
byron The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
byron The single ladies wishing to be double,
byron The situation seems still form'd for fame--
byron The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
byron The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;

byron The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
byron The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:

byron The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.
byron The sound than sense)--beside all these pretences
byron The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.

byron The stars, I own my telescope is dim:
byron The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer--ward
byron The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move
byron The story scarcely pass'd a single lip--
byron The stranger stripling may remain with me;
byron The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly
byron The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.
byron The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
byron The strictest in chronology and virtue
byron The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.
byron The struggle to be pilots in a storm?
byron The suit he thought most suitable to each
byron The sum of their sensations to a second:
byron The sun himself was scarce more free from specks
byron The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
byron The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
byron The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from
byron The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.
byron The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
byron The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,
byron The superstratum which will overlay us.
byron The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
byron The surgeon, as there was no other fee,

byron The tenor; these two hated with a hate
byron The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;

byron The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took

byron The time must come, when both alike decay'd,
byron The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd
byron The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft
byron The tocsin of the soul--the dinner-bell.
byron The tones, the feeling, and the execution,
byron The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase--
byron The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-
byron The town was enter'd: first one column made
byron The town was taken--whether he might yield
byron The train might reach a quarter of a mile:
byron The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd
byron The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd--all 's known--
byron The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on
byron The trouble that they gave, their immorality,
byron The true effect, and so we had better not
byron The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb--
byron The truth in masquerade; and I defy
byron The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:
byron The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
byron The tumulus--of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
byron The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row
byron The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,

byron The tyrant of the Chersonese
byron The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had

byron The unexpected death of some old lady
byron The unusual quickness of these common changes.

byron The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,
byron The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)
byron The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,
byron The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
byron The very Botany Bay in moral geography;
byron The very Suicide that pays his debt
byron The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
byron The very best of vineyards is the cellar.
byron The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,
byron The very clerks,--those somewhat dirty springs
byron The very generations of the dead
byron The very instant, till the change that cast
byron The very lowest find out an inferior,
byron The very model of a chamberlain--
byron The very place where wicked people go.
byron The very shadow of true Truth would shut
byron The very tendon which is most acute
byron The very thing which every body feels,
byron The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
byron The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
byron The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,

byron The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,
byron The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,
byron The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;
byron The waters, and repentance for past sinning
byron The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.
byron The way which they had never trod before,
byron The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
byron The web of these tarantulas each day
byron The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;
byron The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
byron The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,
byron The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought
byron The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,
byron The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
byron The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.
byron The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!
byron The whole together is what I could wish
byron The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
byron The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
byron The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,
byron The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
byron The wind is winged from one point of heaven,
byron The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,
byron The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.
byron The wind was fair, the water passing rough:
byron The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,
byron The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,
byron The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,
byron The women much divided--as is usual
byron The women pardon'd all except her face.
byron The women up, because, in sad reality,

byron The world to gaze upon those northern lights
byron The world upon the whole is worth the assertion
byron The world was not for them, nor the world's art
byron The world will find thee after many days.'
byron The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
byron The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.
byron The world, not the world's masters, will decide,
byron The world, which at the worst 's a glorious blunder--
byron The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste
byron The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
byron The worst of all was, that in their condition,
byron The worst of tempests and the best of battles
byron The worst to know it:--when the mountains rear
byron The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;
byron The wounds they richly merited, and shriek
byron The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
byron Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,
byron Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
byron Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,
byron Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder
byron Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
byron Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
byron Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's
byron Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;
byron Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.
byron Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty
byron Their charity increased about their guest;
byron Their chastity in these unhappy climes
byron Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
byron Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;--
byron Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd
byron Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
byron Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd
byron Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there
byron Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,
byron Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent
byron Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd
byron Their duty was--for they were strong, and though
byron Their energy like life forms all their fame,
byron Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their
byron Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle
byron Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
byron Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,
byron Their flanks;--but it is hardly worth my while
byron Their friends from foes,--besides such things from haste
byron Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
byron Their fury being spent by its own shock,
byron Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
byron Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce
byron Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,
byron Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.
byron Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
byron Their images again as in a glass,
byron Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,
byron Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
byron Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;
byron Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
byron Their leader sang--and bounded to her song,
byron Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or
byron Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;
byron Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
byron Their living freight was now reduced to four,
byron Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
byron Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,
byron Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
byron Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium
byron Their martial faces on the parapet,
byron Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.
byron Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
byron Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.
byron Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill--
byron Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ
byron Their never knowing their own mind two days,
byron Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
byron Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,
byron Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,
byron Their office; he took up an old newspaper;
byron Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
byron Their own true interests, which kings rarely know
byron Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features
byron Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,
byron Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there
byron Their place of birth alone is mute
byron Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,
byron Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less
byron Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
byron Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'
byron Their preservation would have been a miracle.
byron Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
byron Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?
byron Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame
byron Their roar even with the Baltic's--so you be
byron Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,
byron Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
byron Their sofa occupied three parts complete
byron Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,
byron Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
byron Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording
byron Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
byron Their stature, differing but in sex and years;
byron Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
byron Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
byron Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;
byron Their tender parents in their budding days,
byron Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
byron Their union was a model to behold,
byron Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell
byron Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
byron Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;
byron Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,
byron Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;
byron Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works
byron Their work even by the way in which he trode.
byron Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to
byron Theirs being an unnatural situation,
byron Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
byron Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
byron Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,
byron Themselves on innocent tantalisation,
byron Themselves to unity, like this of mine.
byron Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
byron Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,
byron Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
byron Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?
byron Then being taken by the tail--a taking
byron Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,
byron Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
byron Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
byron Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
byron Then changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then
byron Then comes 'the tug of war;'--'t will come again,
byron Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!
byron Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.
byron Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.
byron Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
byron Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar
byron Then having settled his marine affairs,
byron Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
byron Then held that 'high official situation.'
byron Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
byron Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
byron Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
byron Then out it came at length, that to Dudu
byron Then recollecting the whole empress, nor
byron Then rising haughtily he glanced around,
byron Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,
byron Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--
byron Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.
byron Then she was given to charity and pity,
byron Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,
byron Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
byron Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused
byron Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,
byron Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
byron Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
byron Then their relations, who made matters worse.
byron Then there 's more merit in his self-denial.
byron Then there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,
byron Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
byron Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.
byron Then there was small-talk ready when required;
byron Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:
byron Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;--
byron Then there were foreigners of much renown,
byron Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
byron Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp
byron Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
byron Then underneath, and in the very same
byron Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung
byron Then, if she hath not that serene decline
byron Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,
byron Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
byron Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,
byron There 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,
byron There 's doubtless something in domestic doings
byron There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.
byron There 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All
byron There 's little left but to be bored or bore.
byron There 's little strange in this, but something strange is
byron There 's more than one edition, and the readings
byron There 's music in all things, if men had ears:
byron There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
byron There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
byron There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:
byron There 's not a meteor in the polar sky
byron There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
byron There 's nothing in the world like etiquette
byron There 's nothing so becoming to the face.
byron There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw
byron There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
byron There 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:
byron There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
byron There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
byron There 's only one slight difference between
byron There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--
byron There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
byron There 's something of antipathy, as 't were,
byron There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,
byron There also was of course in Adeline
byron There also were some Irish absentees.
byron There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl
byron There being no such profusion in the North
byron There cannot be much conversation there.
byron There captives led in triumph droop the eye,
byron There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
byron There have been and are heroes who begun
byron There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
byron There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
byron There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
byron There is a move set down for joy or sorrow
byron There is a narrowness in such a notion,
byron There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,
byron There is a sort of unexprest concern,
byron There is a tide in the affairs of women
byron There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,
byron There is but one superb menagerie.
byron There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
byron There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.
byron There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
byron There lies the rub--and this they are but weak in.
byron There lies the thing we love with all its errors
byron There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.
byron There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
byron There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells
byron There might arise some pouting petty care
byron There might be one more motive, which makes two;
byron There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then
byron There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;
byron There poets find materials for their books,
byron There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,
byron There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding
byron There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;
byron There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.
byron There solitude, we know, has her full growth in
byron There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink
byron There still are many rainbows in your sky,
byron There surely will be little doubt with some
byron There the large olive rains its amber store
byron There the still varying pangs, which multiply
byron There wanted but the loss of this to wean
byron There wanted but this requisite to swell
byron There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,
byron There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;
byron There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,
byron There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,
byron There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,
byron There was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'
byron There was a man, if that he was a man,
byron There was a self-will even in her small feet,
byron There was a something in his turn of limb,
byron There was a something which bespoke command,
byron There was a way to end their strife, although
byron There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
byron There was an end of Ismail--hapless town!
byron There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
byron There was enthusiasm and much applause,
byron There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;
byron There was just then a kind of a discussion,
byron There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.
byron There was no end unto the things she bought,
byron There was no great disparity of years,
byron There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
byron There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
byron There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
byron There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
byron There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
byron There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
byron There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
byron There was the Duke of Dash, who was a--duke,
byron There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,
byron There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,
byron There was the purest Platonism at bottom
byron There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,
byron There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly
byron There were but two exceptions to this keen
byron There were four Honourable Misters, whose
byron There were some other reasons: the first was,
byron There were the six Miss Rawbolds--pretty dears!
byron There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
byron There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,
byron There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
byron There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
byron There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
byron There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
byron There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
byron There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)
byron Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
byron Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I
byron Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
byron These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
byron These amiable descriptions from the scribes,
byron These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,
byron These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,
byron These don't express one half what I should say:
byron These few short years make wondrous alterations,
byron These first twelve books are merely flourishes,
byron These forty days' advantage of her years--
byron These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads
byron These last had disappear'd--a loss to art:
byron These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,
byron These phrases of refinement I must borrow
byron These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst--
byron These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
byron These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
byron These were advantages: and then he thought--
byron These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
byron These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,
byron Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
byron They 'll never find it out, unless I own
byron They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
byron They 're right; our days are too brief for affording
byron They accuse me--Me--the present writer of
byron They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.
byron They all alike admired their new connection.
byron They all found out as few, or fewer, specks
byron They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.
byron They almost lost their way, and had to pick it--
byron They also gave a petticoat apiece,
byron They also lie too--under a mistake.
byron They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left
byron They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
byron They are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,
byron They are put on as easily as a hat,
byron They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,
byron They are so much intertwisted with the earth;
byron They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
byron They are young, but know not youth--it is anticipated;
byron They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
byron They blew up in the middle of the river,
byron They blush, and we believe them; at least I
byron They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,
byron They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;
byron They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;
byron They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.
byron They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:
byron They changed from room to room--but all forgot--
byron They could not even glean the slightest splinters
byron They could not look more rosy than before.
byron They could not rescue him although so close,
byron They counted thirty, crowded in a space
byron They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
byron They did their best to modify their case,
byron They do not much contribute to his glory.
byron They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,
byron They err'd, as aged men will do; but by
byron They err--'t is merely what is call'd mobility,
byron They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,
byron They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
byron They felt no terrors from the night, they were
byron They felt the freshness of its growing green,
byron They follow'd close behind their sable guide,
byron They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,
byron They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
byron They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
byron They found on their return the self-same welcome,
byron They found that he had fought beneath their banner.
byron They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,
byron They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
byron They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
byron They glared upon each other--all was done,
byron They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,
byron They had but little baggage at their backs,
byron They had not spoken; but they felt allured,
byron They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there
byron They haggled, wrangled, swore, too--so they did!
byron They hate a murderer much less than a claimant
byron They hate me, not I them.--and here we 'll pause.
byron They have a king who buys and sells;
byron They heard next day--that in the Dardanelles,
byron They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,
byron They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe
byron They honour'd such determined scorn of life.
byron They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
byron They journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,
byron They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
byron They knew not what to think of such a freak.
byron They knew not where nor what they were about;
byron They knew not where, being carried by the stream
byron They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar
byron They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
byron They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;
byron They little think what mischief is in hand;
byron They live upon the love of life, and bear
byron They lived respectably as man and wife,
byron They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
byron They lived together, as most people do,
byron They look upon each other, and their eyes
byron They look'd like persons being led to sentence,
byron They look'd so little, did strong things at times--
byron They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
byron They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,
byron They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;
byron They made a fire,--but such a fire as they
byron They made a most superior mess of broth,
byron They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.
byron They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
byron They mean to scold, and very often do;
byron They moved like stars united in their spheres,
byron They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,
byron They must wait several weeks before a mass
byron They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'
byron They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.
byron They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
byron They only add them all in an appendix,
byron They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
byron They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,
byron They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
byron They put beholders in a tender taking;
byron They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.
byron They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door
byron They run before the wind through high seas breaking;
byron They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;
byron They say his system 't is in vain to batter,
byron They say no more of Death or of the Lady.
byron They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
byron They say you like it too--'t is no great wonder.
byron They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
byron They separated at an early hour;
byron They shall appear before your curious eyes,
byron They should at least have fifty rubles round,
byron They should have lived together deep in woods,
byron They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,
byron They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong
byron They smile still more, and then there intervene
byron They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
byron They sometimes also get a little tired
byron They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
byron They spoke by signs--that is, not spoke at all;
byron They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
byron They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.
byron They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its
byron They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
byron They thought that in such perils, more than chance
byron They thus address'd--and Lambro's visage fell--
byron They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.
byron They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
byron They took the bastion, which the Seraskier
byron They tried the pumps again, and though before
byron They trod as upon necks; and to complete
byron They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,
byron They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;
byron They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,
byron They were all summer: lightning might assail
byron They were alone once more; for them to be
byron They were alone, but not alone as they
byron They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb--
byron They were not made in the real world to fill
byron They were relations, and for them he had a
byron They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
byron They will destroy a face which mortal thought
byron They won't lay out their money on the dead--
byron They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be
byron They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.
byron They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.
byron They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
byron They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
byron They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.
byron Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,
byron Thine ear, if it should reach--and now rhymes wander
byron Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
byron Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,
byron Think how the joys of reading a Gazette
byron Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
byron Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all--
byron Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
byron Think what it is to be in your old age
byron Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
byron Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
byron Think'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise
byron Thinking unutterable things; he threw
byron Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;
byron Thirdly, commence not with the end--or, sinning
byron Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,
byron This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
byron This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
byron This I must leave sultanas to decide:
byron This I will say--my reasons are my own--
byron This awkward business without harm to others,
byron This being the case, may show us what Fame is:
byron This chieftain--somehow would not yield at all:
byron This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'
byron This circumstance may serve to give a notion
byron This compliment, which drew all eyes upon
byron This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew
byron This feeling 't is not easy to express,
byron This fellow, being six foot high, could raise
byron This great philosopher was thus instilling
byron This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
byron This he discreetly kept in the background,
byron This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
byron This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
byron This is a fact and no poetic fable--
byron This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
byron This is in others a factitious state,
byron This is no bull, although it sounds so; for
byron This is the age of oddities let loose,
byron This is the literary lower empire,
byron This is the patent-age of new inventions
byron This is the way physicians mend or end us,
byron This is true criticism, and you may kiss--
byron This labyrinth of females, and each station
byron This liberty is a poetic licence,
byron This long parenthesis: I could not shut
byron This massy portal stood at the wide close
byron This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty--
byron This may be superstition, weak or wild,
byron This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
byron This modern Amazon and queen of queans;
byron This monstrous tale had probably its source
byron This narrative is not meant for narration,
byron This noble personage began to look
byron This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
byron This paradise of pleasure and ennui.
byron This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk
byron This poem will become a moral model.
byron This pretty gentleman within the closet:
byron This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.
byron This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.
byron This secret charge on Juan, to display
byron This simile enough for Ajax, Juan
byron This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,
byron This sort of adoration of the real
byron This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;
byron This special honour was conferr'd, because
byron This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,
byron This story is not moral, first, I pray,
byron This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring
byron This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
byron This subject quote; as it would be schismatic
byron This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,
byron This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
byron This was Potemkin--a great thing in days
byron This was a truth to us extremely trite;
byron This was an awkward test, as Juan found,
byron This was an easy matter with a man
byron This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,
byron This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings--
byron This way of writing will appear exotic;
byron This we pass over. We will also pass
byron This weakness in a few hours, and recover.
byron This were the worst desertion:--renegadoes,
byron This works a world of sentimental woe,
byron This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.
byron This, though not large, was one of the most rich.
byron This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan--
byron This--when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.
byron Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
byron Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved
byron Those became one who soon were to be two,
byron Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;
byron Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove--
byron Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
byron Those gay recesses:--many a precious stone
byron Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt
byron Those honourable scars which brought him fame;
byron Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
byron Those little glitterers of the London night;
byron Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
byron Those movements, those improvements in our bodies
byron Those navigators must be able seamen
byron Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;
byron Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.
byron Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in
byron Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:
byron Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.
byron Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
byron Those vegetables of the Catholic creed
byron Those who catch cold in 'shadows of Death's valley.'
byron Those who dislike to look upon a fray,
byron Those who will leave you of no sex at all.
byron Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,
byron Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels
byron Thou art in London--in that pleasant place,
byron Thou art no novice in the headlong chase
byron Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.
byron Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
byron Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
byron Thou gate of life and death--thou nondescript!
byron Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,
byron Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus
byron Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
byron Thou moral Washington of Africa!
byron Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
byron Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'
byron Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
byron Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
byron Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
byron Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
byron Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though
byron Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,
byron Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,
byron Though I acquired--but I pass over that,
byron Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.
byron Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice
byron Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,
byron Though all deserving equally to turn
byron Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,
byron Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,
byron Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,
byron Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing
byron Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,
byron Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,
byron Though certes by no means so grand a sight
byron Though despots know it not--till the progression
byron Though differing in stature and degree,
byron Though doubtless he who can command himself
byron Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange
byron Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,
byron Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,
byron Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,
byron Though foe to love; and yet they could not be
byron Though full of all things which could be desired,
byron Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-
byron Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,
byron Though he deserved it well for being so backward,
byron Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.
byron Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,
byron Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,
byron Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within
byron Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,
byron Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,
byron Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;
byron Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
byron Though little versed in feelings oriental,
byron Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:
byron Though nameless in our language:--we retort
byron Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:
byron Though not for want of matter; but 't is time
byron Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more
byron Though on all other things with looks intense
byron Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers
byron Though on the wave's high top too much to set,
byron Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy
byron Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'
byron Though rather more irregularly spotted:
byron Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
byron Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,
byron Though several also keep their perpendicular
byron Though several thousand people chose to try,
byron Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,
byron Though sleeping like a lion near a source.
byron Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile
byron Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,
byron Though such a she 's a devil (if that there be one),
byron Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;
byron Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd
byron Though there 's a shorter a good deal than this,
byron Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,
byron Though this might ruin others, it did not him,
byron Though travell'd, I have never had the luck to
byron Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.
byron Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
byron Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,
byron Though why I cannot say--at least this minute.
byron Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)
byron Thought daily service was her only mission,
byron Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.
byron Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,
byron Thought such an opportunity as this is,
byron Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,--how happy they!
byron Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group
byron Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!
byron Three fireships lost their amiable existence
byron Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,
byron Three lines of the despatch in taking 'Schmacksmith,'
byron Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best
byron Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
byron Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
byron Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
byron Threw them all down into the ditch again.
byron Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,
byron Thrice happy he who, after a survey
byron Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt
byron Thrice happy they who have an occupation!
byron Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread
byron Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset
byron Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'
byron Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw
byron Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees
byron Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'
byron Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name
byron Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter
byron Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl
byron Through fifty victories to shame or fame--
byron Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,
byron Through his means and the church's might be paved.
byron Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is
byron Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth
byron Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd
byron Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;
byron Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
byron Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.

shakespeare An you re us and fa us, you note us.
shakespeare Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
shakespeare And 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,
shakespeare And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
shakespeare And (as I thinke) they haue already order
shakespeare And (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;
shakespeare And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake
shakespeare And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,
shakespeare And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
shakespeare And Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things
shakespeare And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,
shakespeare And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
shakespeare And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,
shakespeare And Guardian of their Bones
shakespeare And Honor
shakespeare And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine.
shakespeare And I am proof against their enmity.
shakespeare And I am sicke at heart
shakespeare And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:
shakespeare And I beseech you instantly to visit
shakespeare And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose
shakespeare And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
shakespeare And I for sorrow sung,
shakespeare And I the Mistris of your Charmes,
shakespeare And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse
shakespeare And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes,
shakespeare And I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,
shakespeare And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
shakespeare And I'll believe thee.
shakespeare And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
shakespeare And I, for winking at your discords too,
shakespeare And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare
shakespeare And Ile request your presence
shakespeare And Juliet bleeding; warm, and newly dead,
shakespeare And Paris too:--come, I'll dispose of thee
shakespeare And Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,
shakespeare And Prophecying, with Accents terrible,
shakespeare And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
shakespeare And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
shakespeare And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
shakespeare And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
shakespeare And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome;
shakespeare And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous:
shakespeare And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,
shakespeare And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
shakespeare And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,
shakespeare And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
shakespeare And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
shakespeare And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles
shakespeare And all the better is it for the maid:
shakespeare And all things change them to the contrary.
shakespeare And all things else, that might
shakespeare And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
shakespeare And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
shakespeare And all those twenty could but kill one life.
shakespeare And all to all
shakespeare And all we waile for
shakespeare And all-thing vnbecomming
shakespeare And am most sensible in greefe for it,
shakespeare And an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.
shakespeare And an old hare hoar,

shakespeare And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then,--
shakespeare And as a stranger to my heart and me
shakespeare And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
shakespeare And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
shakespeare And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so
shakespeare And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,
shakespeare And as the world were now but to begin,
shakespeare And as you said, and wisely was it said,
shakespeare And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,
shakespeare And at the pit of Acheron
shakespeare And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
shakespeare And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,
shakespeare And bad'st me bury love.
shakespeare And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
shakespeare And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?
shakespeare And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.
shakespeare And be not from his reason falne thereon;
shakespeare And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,
shakespeare And bear this work of heaven with patience:
shakespeare And bear't before him, thereby shall we shadow
shakespeare And beare it to the Chappell
shakespeare And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?
shakespeare And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
shakespeare And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,--
shakespeare And bid him come to take his last farewell.
shakespeare And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
shakespeare And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
shakespeare And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,
shakespeare And binde vs further to you
shakespeare And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
shakespeare And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,
shakespeare And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,
shakespeare And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee
shakespeare And breake your owne necke downe
shakespeare And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
shakespeare And bring in cloudy night immediately.--
shakespeare And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is
shakespeare And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
shakespeare And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make
shakespeare And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
shakespeare And by the happy hollow of a tree
shakespeare And by-and-by my master drew on him;
shakespeare And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence
shakespeare And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
shakespeare And carriage of the Article designe,
shakespeare And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
shakespeare And champion me to th' vtterance.
shakespeare And chastise with the valour of my Tongue
shakespeare And choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald
shakespeare And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:
shakespeare And could of men distinguish, her election
shakespeare And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
shakespeare And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
shakespeare And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
shakespeare And damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare
shakespeare And damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.
shakespeare And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
shakespeare And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--
shakespeare And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
shakespeare And did shake
shakespeare And do not interrupt me in my course.
shakespeare And do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor
shakespeare And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,
shakespeare And do such bitter businesse as the day
shakespeare And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father
shakespeare And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
shakespeare And doth it give me such a sight as this?
shakespeare And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?
shakespeare And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
shakespeare And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede
shakespeare And each particular haire to stand an end,
shakespeare And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,
shakespeare And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
shakespeare And euery one shall share i'th' gaines:
shakespeare And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.
shakespeare And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet
shakespeare And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
shakespeare And fanne our people cold.
shakespeare And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
shakespeare And fearfully did menace me with death
shakespeare And find I am alone felicitate
shakespeare And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
shakespeare And finding him, the searchers of the town,
shakespeare And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!--
shakespeare And fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements
shakespeare And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
shakespeare And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
shakespeare And for his Issue, whose heauie hand
shakespeare And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
shakespeare And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,
shakespeare And for that name, which is no part of thee,
shakespeare And for that offence
shakespeare And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
shakespeare And for your part Ophelia, I do wish
shakespeare And from her womb children of divers kind
shakespeare And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
shakespeare And from my soul too;
shakespeare And gather by him, as he is behaued,
shakespeare And gave him what becomed love I might,
shakespeare And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:
shakespeare And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
shakespeare And go the fools among.
shakespeare And go, Sir Paris;--every one prepare
shakespeare And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!
shakespeare And hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,
shakespeare And hath shipped me intill the Land,
shakespeare And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties
shakespeare And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,
shakespeare And he shall signify from time to time
shakespeare And he to England shall along with you:
shakespeare And he will make the face of heaven so fine
shakespeare And health on both
shakespeare And heere from gracious England haue I offer
shakespeare And her immortal part with angels lives.
shakespeare And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
shakespeare And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters
shakespeare And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,
shakespeare And here is come to do some villanous shame
shakespeare And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
shakespeare And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
shakespeare And hire post-horses. I will hence to-night.
shakespeare And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
shakespeare And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
shakespeare And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,
shakespeare And his to me:
shakespeare And hither shall he come: and he and I
shakespeare And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,
shakespeare And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!
shakespeare And hold thee to my Heart
shakespeare And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:
shakespeare And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
shakespeare And hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time
shakespeare And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that
shakespeare And in his brainish apprehension killes
shakespeare And in his commendations, I am fed:
shakespeare And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
shakespeare And in my temper soften'd valour's steel.
shakespeare And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?
shakespeare And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
shakespeare And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
shakespeare And in the most exact regard support
shakespeare And in the taste confounds the appetite:
shakespeare And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
shakespeare And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
shakespeare And in this state she gallops night by night
shakespeare And in thy best consideration check
shakespeare And is it not, then, well served in to a sweet goose?
shakespeare And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
shakespeare And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
shakespeare And joy comes well in such a needy time:
shakespeare And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;--
shakespeare And keep in-a-door,
shakespeare And keepe a Farme and Carters
shakespeare And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,
shakespeare And keepe within the reare of your Affection;
shakespeare And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
shakespeare And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
shakespeare And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
shakespeare And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
shakespeare And learn me how to lose a winning match,
shakespeare And leave him all; life, living, all is death's.
shakespeare And leave thee in the storm.
shakespeare And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
shakespeare And let him know so
shakespeare And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
shakespeare And let mischance be slave to patience.--
shakespeare And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd
shakespeare And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
shakespeare And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
shakespeare And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this
shakespeare And let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking,
shakespeare And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
shakespeare And light thee on the way to Mantua:
shakespeare And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.
shakespeare And like a Rat without a tayle,
shakespeare And like a man to double businesse bound,
shakespeare And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,
shakespeare And little is to do
shakespeare And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
shakespeare And liue the purer with the other halfe.
shakespeare And liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.
shakespeare And looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see
shakespeare And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,
shakespeare And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
shakespeare And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
shakespeare And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,
shakespeare And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,
shakespeare And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen
shakespeare And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes
shakespeare And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse
shakespeare And makes each petty Artire in this body,
shakespeare And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
shakespeare And many vnruffe youths, that euen now
shakespeare And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
shakespeare And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
shakespeare And meet i'th' Hall together
shakespeare And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,
shakespeare And mingle with the English Epicures,
shakespeare And more I begge not.
shakespeare And more aboue hath his soliciting,
shakespeare And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
shakespeare And mouncht, & mouncht, and mouncht:
shakespeare And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:
shakespeare And must be hang'd
shakespeare And my Imaginations are as foule
shakespeare And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
shakespeare And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce
shakespeare And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,--
shakespeare And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.
shakespeare And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall
shakespeare And never from this palace of dim night
shakespeare And never trouble Peter for the matter.
shakespeare And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
shakespeare And none serue with him, but constrained things,
shakespeare And not impute this yielding to light love,
shakespeare And nothing is, but what is not
shakespeare And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
shakespeare And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,
shakespeare And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?
shakespeare And now about the Cauldron sing
shakespeare And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
shakespeare And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
shakespeare And now reignes heere.
shakespeare And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
shakespeare And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,
shakespeare And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
shakespeare And on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,
shakespeare And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,
shakespeare And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,
shakespeare And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery
shakespeare And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
shakespeare And passion in the Gods
shakespeare And pay no worship to the garish sun.--
shakespeare And peculiar life is bound
shakespeare And pious Action, we do surge o're
shakespeare And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,
shakespeare And play the humble Host:
shakespeare And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
shakespeare And points at them for his. What? is this so?
shakespeare And powr'd them downe before him
shakespeare And presently took post to tell it you:
shakespeare And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
shakespeare And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,
shakespeare And push vs from our stooles. This is more strange
shakespeare And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,
shakespeare And put it in his Pocket
shakespeare And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.--
shakespeare And question this most bloody piece of worke,
shakespeare And reaks not his owne reade
shakespeare And reason coldly of your grievances,
shakespeare And sails upon the bosom of the air.
shakespeare And say, it is not so.
shakespeare And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,
shakespeare And sayest thou yet that exile is not death!
shakespeare And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
shakespeare And see how he will take it at your hands.
shakespeare And see how one another lends content;
shakespeare And set a double varnish on the fame
shakespeare And set forth a deepe Repentance:
shakespeare And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.
shakespeare And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
shakespeare And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;
shakespeare And she as much in love, her means much less
shakespeare And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
shakespeare And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
shakespeare And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
shakespeare And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
shakespeare And shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)
shakespeare And shew the best of our delights.
shakespeare And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
shakespeare And shut vp in measurelesse content
shakespeare And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,
shakespeare And slay thy lady, too, that lives in thee,
shakespeare And sleepe in spight of Thunder.
shakespeare And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
shakespeare And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
shakespeare And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.
shakespeare And so I doe commend you to their backs.
shakespeare And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,
shakespeare And so did I.
shakespeare And so did I; well, we were born to die.
shakespeare And so good Capulet,--which name I tender
shakespeare And so his Knell is knoll'd
shakespeare And so, without more circumstance at all,
shakespeare And soar with them above a common bound.
shakespeare And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting
shakespeare And something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,
shakespeare And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
shakespeare And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey-wall:
shakespeare And steal immortal blessing from her lips;
shakespeare And steep'd in blood?--Ah, what an unkind hour
shakespeare And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,
shakespeare And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,
shakespeare And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
shakespeare And stole into the covert of the wood:
shakespeare And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
shakespeare And such a daughter,
shakespeare And such an Instrument I was to vse.
shakespeare And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,
shakespeare And take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,
shakespeare And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,
shakespeare And tell you what I know
shakespeare And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
shakespeare And that bare vowel I shall poison more
shakespeare And that distill'd by Magicke slights,
shakespeare And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke
shakespeare And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
shakespeare And that my master slew him.
shakespeare And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
shakespeare And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
shakespeare And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
shakespeare And that we have a curse in having her:
shakespeare And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,
shakespeare And that which should accompany Old-Age,
shakespeare And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene
shakespeare And the Crow makes Wing toth' Rookie Wood:
shakespeare And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?
shakespeare And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,
shakespeare And the continuance of their parents' rage,
shakespeare And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
shakespeare And the place death, considering who thou art,
shakespeare And the rich East to boot
shakespeare And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
shakespeare And the very Ports they blow,
shakespeare And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
shakespeare And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
shakespeare And then I ran away to call the watch.
shakespeare And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
shakespeare And then down falls again.
shakespeare And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
shakespeare And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
shakespeare And then in post he came from Mantua
shakespeare And then is heard no more. It is a Tale
shakespeare And then my husband,--God be with his soul!
shakespeare And then to have a wretched puling fool,
shakespeare And then will I be general of your woes,
shakespeare And there I am:--where is my Romeo?
shakespeare And there I see such blacke and grained spots,
shakespeare And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
shakespeare And there an end: But now they rise againe
shakespeare And there assumes some other horrible forme,
shakespeare And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
shakespeare And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
shakespeare And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell
shakespeare And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
shakespeare And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
shakespeare And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd
shakespeare And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:
shakespeare And thereto add such reasons of your own
shakespeare And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?
shakespeare And these few Precepts in thy memory,
shakespeare And they in France of the best ranck and station,
shakespeare And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
shakespeare And this distilled liquor drink thou off:
shakespeare And this same needy man must sell it me.
shakespeare And this shall free thee from this present shame,
shakespeare And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
shakespeare And thou art wedded to calamity.
shakespeare And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
shakespeare And thou hadst not come to my bed
shakespeare And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,
shakespeare And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,
shakespeare And thou shalt have more
shakespeare And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,
shakespeare And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
shakespeare And thrice againe, to make vp nine.
shakespeare And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
shakespeare And thus I know his father and his friends,
shakespeare And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
shakespeare And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,
shakespeare And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
shakespeare And thy Commandment all alone shall liue
shakespeare And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
shakespeare And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
shakespeare And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.
shakespeare And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,
shakespeare And to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:
shakespeare And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,
shakespeare And to the last, bended their light on me
shakespeare And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
shakespeare And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
shakespeare And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
shakespeare And top of Soueraignty?
shakespeare And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
shakespeare And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
shakespeare And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
shakespeare And usest none in that true use indeed
shakespeare And vanisht from our sight
shakespeare And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
shakespeare And vice sometimes by action dignified.
shakespeare And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement
shakespeare And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare
shakespeare And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
shakespeare And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
shakespeare And we mean well, in going to this mask;
shakespeare And weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round
shakespeare And wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,
shakespeare And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
shakespeare And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
shakespeare And went further, which is now
shakespeare And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
shakespeare And what love can do, that dares love attempt;
shakespeare And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?
shakespeare And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,
shakespeare And what to?
shakespeare And what will you do now? How will you liue?
shakespeare And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,
shakespeare And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,
shakespeare And when we haue our naked Frailties hid,
shakespeare And when you are desirous to be blest,
shakespeare And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd
shakespeare And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
shakespeare And where the worser is predominant,
shakespeare And which is worse, all you haue done
shakespeare And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
shakespeare And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
shakespeare And will not let beleefe take hold of him
shakespeare And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
shakespeare And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
shakespeare And with a larger tether may he walke,
shakespeare And with a looke so pitious in purport,
shakespeare And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
shakespeare And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
shakespeare And with him poure we in our Countries purge,
shakespeare And with his former Title greet Macbeth
shakespeare And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,
shakespeare And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
shakespeare And with my child my joys are buried!
shakespeare And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
shakespeare And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote
shakespeare And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,
shakespeare And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
shakespeare And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
shakespeare And with this knife I'll help it presently.
shakespeare And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand
shakespeare And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
shakespeare And world's exile is death,--then banished
shakespeare And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,
shakespeare And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
shakespeare And yet I would it were to give again.
shakespeare And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee
shakespeare And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught
shakespeare And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:
shakespeare And yet hee's Father-lesse
shakespeare And yet no farther than a wanton's bird;
shakespeare And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
shakespeare And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
shakespeare And yet not proud:--mistress minion, you,
shakespeare And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
shakespeare And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:
shakespeare And yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,
shakespeare And yet would'st wrongly winne.
shakespeare And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete
shakespeare And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
shakespeare And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,--
shakespeare And you all know, Security
shakespeare And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;
shakespeare And you must put me in your heart for Friend,
shakespeare And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
shakespeare And you whose places are the nearest, know,
shakespeare And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it
shakespeare And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
shakespeare And young affection gapes to be his heir;
shakespeare And your poore Seruant euer
shakespeare And, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
shakespeare And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
shakespeare And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
shakespeare And, but thou love me, let them find me here.
shakespeare And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
shakespeare And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
shakespeare And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
shakespeare And, in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
shakespeare And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
shakespeare And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
shakespeare And, like a sister, am most loath to call
shakespeare And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
shakespeare And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
shakespeare And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
shakespeare And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
shakespeare And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
shakespeare And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
shakespeare Ang. Neere Byrnan wood
shakespeare Ang. Now do's he feele
shakespeare Ang. Wee are sent,
shakespeare Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,
shakespeare Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
shakespeare Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
shakespeare Anon, anon!
shakespeare Anon, good nurse!--Sweet Montague, be true.
shakespeare Anon.
shakespeare Anon?
shakespeare Another yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:
shakespeare Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
shakespeare Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,
shakespeare Antony! and Potpan!
shakespeare Any man that can write may answer a letter.
shakespeare Apothecary.
shakespeare Appar. Be bloody, bold, & resolute:
shakespeare Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
shakespeare Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
shakespeare Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,

shakespeare Are ioyfully return'd
shakespeare Are lesse then horrible Imaginings:
shakespeare Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!
shakespeare Are made already mothers: by my count
shakespeare Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes
shakespeare Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
shakespeare Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
shakespeare Are stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them
shakespeare Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
shakespeare Are with a most indissoluble tye
shakespeare Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
shakespeare Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
shakespeare Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,
shakespeare Are you so hot? marry,come up, I trow;
shakespeare Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
shakespeare Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
shakespeare Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,
shakespeare Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
shakespeare Aroynt thee, Witch, the rumpe-fed Ronyon cryes.
shakespeare Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
shakespeare Art not without Ambition, but without
shakespeare Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art;
shakespeare Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!
shakespeare Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
shakespeare Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
shakespeare As 'twere a carelesse Trifle
shakespeare As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
shakespeare As Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,
shakespeare As Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes,
shakespeare As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,
shakespeare As Hounds, and Greyhounds, Mungrels, Spaniels, Curres,
shakespeare As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
shakespeare As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
shakespeare As I do thee. Something too much of this.
shakespeare As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found
shakespeare As I intended, for it wrought on her
shakespeare As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
shakespeare As I remember, this should be the house:
shakespeare As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.
shakespeare As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,
shakespeare As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
shakespeare As Phaeton would whip you to the west
shakespeare As Reason panders Will
shakespeare As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,
shakespeare As all the world--why he's a man of wax.
shakespeare As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
shakespeare As are Companions noted and most knowne
shakespeare As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
shakespeare As broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:
shakespeare As by the strength of their illusion,
shakespeare As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,
shakespeare As day do's to your eye.
shakespeare As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
shakespeare As dearly as mine own,--be satisfied.
shakespeare As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?
shakespeare As easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre
shakespeare As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall
shakespeare As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,

shakespeare As from the body of Contraction pluckes
shakespeare As from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,
shakespeare As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
shakespeare As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd
shakespeare As happy Prologues to the swelling Act
shakespeare As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:
shakespeare As he in his peculiar Sect and force
shakespeare As he is very potent with such Spirits,
shakespeare As he was coming from this churchyard side.
shakespeare As he would draw it. Long staid he so,
shakespeare As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
shakespeare As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder
shakespeare As if encrease of Appetite had growne
shakespeare As if he had been loosed out of hell,

shakespeare As if it some impartment did desire
shakespeare As if that name,

shakespeare As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,
shakespeare As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
shakespeare As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
shakespeare As my great patron thought on in my prayers-
shakespeare As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,
shakespeare As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
shakespeare As of a Father; For let the world take note,
shakespeare As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,
shakespeare As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
shakespeare As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
shakespeare As one that had beene studied in his death,
shakespeare As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
shakespeare As seemeth by his plight, of the Reuolt
shakespeare As she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies
shakespeare As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
shakespeare As that is desperate which we would prevent.
shakespeare As that of true and faithful Juliet.
shakespeare As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
shakespeare As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,

shakespeare As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
shakespeare As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
shakespeare As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
shakespeare Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
shakespeare Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,
shakespeare Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,
shakespeare At first and last, the hearty welcome
shakespeare At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
shakespeare At friend, or so, and Gentleman
shakespeare At gaming, swearing, or about some acte
shakespeare At his head a grasse-greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone.
shakespeare At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
shakespeare At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;
shakespeare At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
shakespeare At least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.
shakespeare At my poor house look to behold this night
shakespeare At no time broke my Faith, would not betray
shakespeare At one fell swoope?
shakespeare At our great bidding
shakespeare At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,

shakespeare At the hour of nine.
shakespeare At what o'clock to-morrow
shakespeare Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:

shakespeare Attendants.
shakespeare Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone
shakespeare Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue

shakespeare Hath had no notice of these accidents;
shakespeare Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
shakespeare Hath in him clos'd: whereby he does receiue
shakespeare Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
shakespeare Hath lost me in your liking.
shakespeare Hath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,
shakespeare Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
shakespeare Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way,
shakespeare Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
shakespeare Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
shakespeare Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least
shakespeare Hath rung Nights yawning Peale,
shakespeare Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene
shakespeare Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
shakespeare Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
shakespeare Hath so exasperate their King, that hee

shakespeare Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
shakespeare Have lost a brace of kinsmen:--all are punish'd.
shakespeare Have more than thou showest,
shakespeare Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?
shakespeare Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
shakespeare Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
shakespeare Have they been merry! which their keepers call
shakespeare Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets;
shakespeare Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

shakespeare Having displeas'd my father, to Lawrence' cell,
shakespeare Having some business, do entreat her eyes
shakespeare Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow
shakespeare He Descends.
shakespeare He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
shakespeare He bears him like a portly gentleman;
shakespeare He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
shakespeare He closes with you in this consequence:
shakespeare He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,
shakespeare He does: what was I about to say?

shakespeare He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes
shakespeare He is a kinsman to the Montague,

shakespeare He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone,
shakespeare He is wise;
shakespeare He jests at scars that never felt a wound.--
shakespeare He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
shakespeare He made you for a highway to my bed;
shakespeare He may approue our eyes, and speake to it
shakespeare He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs
shakespeare He onely liu'd but till he was a man,
shakespeare He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
shakespeare He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
shakespeare He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
shakespeare He shall be endur'd:
shakespeare He shall liue a man forbid:
shakespeare He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
shakespeare He shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare
shakespeare He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
shakespeare He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
shakespeare He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found
shakespeare He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
shakespeare He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
shakespeare He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,
shakespeare He walkes foure houres together, heere
shakespeare He wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren
shakespeare He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
shakespeare He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
shakespeare He will againe be well. If much you note him
shakespeare He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?
shakespeare He'll shape his old course in a country new.

shakespeare Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
shakespeare Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure
shakespeare Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,

shakespeare I 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,
shakespeare I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
shakespeare I am a man againe: pray you sit still
shakespeare I am as I haue spoken
shakespeare I am aweary, give me leave awhile;--
shakespeare I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
shakespeare I am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend
shakespeare I am for you. [Drawing.]
shakespeare I am hurt;--
shakespeare I am in this earthly world: where to do harme
shakespeare I am not I if there be such an I;
shakespeare I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
shakespeare I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
shakespeare I am the greatest, able to do least,
shakespeare I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
shakespeare I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
shakespeare I am too young,--I pray you pardon me:'--
shakespeare I bade her come.--What, lamb! what ladybird!--
shakespeare I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo,
shakespeare I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld
shakespeare I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
shakespeare I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
shakespeare I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
shakespeare I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,
shakespeare I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have
shakespeare I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
shakespeare I cannot but remember such things were
shakespeare I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
shakespeare I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both,
shakespeare I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes
shakespeare I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
shakespeare I cannot taint with Feare. What's the Boy Malcolme?
shakespeare I cannot tell: but I am faint,
shakespeare I care not if thou dost for me as much.
shakespeare I charge thee in the prince's name obey.
shakespeare I come anon.-- But if thou meanest not well,
shakespeare I come from Lady Juliet.
shakespeare I conjure only but to raise up him.
shakespeare I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
shakespeare I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
shakespeare I could not but by her. The other Motiue,
shakespeare I could not send it,--here it is again,--
shakespeare I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,
shakespeare I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
shakespeare I dare abide no longer.
shakespeare I dare not, sir;
shakespeare I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
shakespeare I do beseech thee,--
shakespeare I do beseech you giue him leaue to go
shakespeare I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
shakespeare I do defy thy conjurations,
shakespeare I do invest you jointly in my power,
shakespeare I do protest I never injur'd thee;
shakespeare I do remember an apothecary,--
shakespeare I do remember well where I should be,
shakespeare I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,
shakespeare I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
shakespeare I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
shakespeare I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.
shakespeare I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
shakespeare I dreamt a dream to-night.
shakespeare I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,--
shakespeare I dreamt my master and another fought,
shakespeare I drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,
shakespeare I fear it is: and yet methinks it should not,
shakespeare I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
shakespeare I find she names my very deed of love;
shakespeare I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
shakespeare I had daughters.
shakespeare I had else beene perfect;
shakespeare I had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,
shakespeare I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,
shakespeare I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
shakespeare I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,
shakespeare I haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing
shakespeare I haue almost slipt the houre
shakespeare I haue bad dreames
shakespeare I haue begun to plant thee, and will labour
shakespeare I haue done no harme. But I remember now
shakespeare I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,
shakespeare I haue in quicke determination
shakespeare I haue liu'd long enough: my way of life
shakespeare I haue no rellish of them, but abound
shakespeare I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen
shakespeare I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
shakespeare I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
shakespeare I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
shakespeare I have been feasting with mine enemy;
shakespeare I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.
shakespeare I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
shakespeare I have forgot why I did call thee back.
shakespeare I have it, and soundly too.--Your houses!
shakespeare I have more care to stay than will to go.--
shakespeare I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
shakespeare I have no joy of this contract to-night;
shakespeare I have.
shakespeare I hear some noise within: dear love, adieu!--
shakespeare I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest
shakespeare I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
shakespeare I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send
shakespeare I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
shakespeare I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,
shakespeare I keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow
shakespeare I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene
shakespeare I know not how to tell thee who I am:
shakespeare I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;
shakespeare I know not, sir.
shakespeare I know not.
shakespeare I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you
shakespeare I look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought
shakespeare I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,
shakespeare I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
shakespeare I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
shakespeare I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
shakespeare I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.
shakespeare I mean, sir, in delay
shakespeare I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell;
shakespeare I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;
shakespeare I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
shakespeare I must become a borrower of the Night,
shakespeare I must hear from thee every day i' the hour,
shakespeare I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.--
shakespeare I must needs wake you.--lady! lady! lady!--
shakespeare I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,
shakespeare I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
shakespeare I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!--
shakespeare I never should forget it; 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
shakespeare I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal;
shakespeare I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
shakespeare I pray thee chide not: she whom I love now
shakespeare I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
shakespeare I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night;
shakespeare I pray you now, receiue them
shakespeare I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,
shakespeare I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
shakespeare I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!
shakespeare I promise you, but for your company,
shakespeare I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg
shakespeare I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,
shakespeare I put my selfe to thy Direction, and
shakespeare I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
shakespeare I saw him enter such a house of saile;
shakespeare I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
shakespeare I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
shakespeare I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God
shakespeare I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
shakespeare I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.
shakespeare I say, a mouing Groue
shakespeare I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are
shakespeare I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,
shakespeare I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
shakespeare I shall not be his wife.
shakespeare I shall not look vpon his like againe
shakespeare I sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,
shakespeare I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,
shakespeare I should haue fatted all the Region Kites
shakespeare I should have been more strange, I must confess,
shakespeare I should report that which I say I saw,
shakespeare I speak no treason.
shakespeare I speake not as in absolute feare of you:
shakespeare I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
shakespeare I stay too long; but here my Father comes:
shakespeare I stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,
shakespeare I stretch it out for that word broad: which added to the
shakespeare I strike quickly, being moved.
shakespeare I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile
shakespeare I take my leaue at once.
shakespeare I take thee at thy word:
shakespeare I tell thee what,--get thee to church o' Thursday,
shakespeare I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,
shakespeare I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shakespeare I thank you, honest gentlemen; good-night.--
shakespeare I think it best you married with the county.
shakespeare I think you are happy in this second match,
shakespeare I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding
shakespeare I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,
shakespeare I thinke, but dare not speake
shakespeare I thought all for the best.
shakespeare I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
shakespeare I throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,
shakespeare I wake before the time that Romeo
shakespeare I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
shakespeare I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
shakespeare I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?
shakespeare I was your mother much upon these years
shakespeare I will aduise you where to plant your selues,
shakespeare I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:
shakespeare I will be brief, for my short date of breath
shakespeare I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
shakespeare I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
shakespeare I will bestow him, and will answer well
shakespeare I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
shakespeare I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, I'll fa you: do you note
shakespeare I will come by and by
shakespeare I will confess to you that I love him.
shakespeare I will cut off their heads.
shakespeare I will follow you.
shakespeare I will leaue him,
shakespeare I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,
shakespeare I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
shakespeare I will not entertain so bad a thought.--
shakespeare I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
shakespeare I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
shakespeare I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
shakespeare I will omit no opportunity
shakespeare I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:

shakespeare I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

shakespeare I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
shakespeare I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
shakespeare I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;

shakespeare Importing the surrender of those Lands
shakespeare In England, and in Ireland, not confessing
shakespeare In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene
shakespeare In Riddles, and Affaires of death;
shakespeare In Thunder, Lightning, or in Raine?
shakespeare In all her best array bear her to church;
shakespeare In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.--
shakespeare In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:
shakespeare In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
shakespeare In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize

shakespeare In deepest consequence.
shakespeare In doing it, payes it selfe.
shakespeare In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,

shakespeare In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
shakespeare In euils, to top Macbeth
shakespeare In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
shakespeare In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face:--
shakespeare In filiall Obligation, for some terme
shakespeare In generall Synod take away her power:
shakespeare In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
shakespeare In half an hour she promis'd to return.
shakespeare In his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
shakespeare In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd
shakespeare In honourable fashion
shakespeare In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore Ophelia
shakespeare In ill breeding minds. Let her come in.
shakespeare In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
shakespeare In man as well as herbs,--grace and rude will;
shakespeare In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,
shakespeare In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?--
shakespeare In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,
shakespeare In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
shakespeare In my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart,
shakespeare In my most ill-composd Affection, such
shakespeare In neither ought, or in extremity:

shakespeare In obstinate Condolement, is a course
shakespeare In one respect I'll thy assistant be;

shakespeare In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities:
shakespeare In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
shakespeare In restlesse extasie.
shakespeare In second Husband, let me be accurst,
shakespeare In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
shakespeare In such a gorgeous palace!
shakespeare In such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,
shakespeare In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
shakespeare In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
shakespeare In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.--
shakespeare In the Cauldron boyle and bake:
shakespeare In the Lobby
shakespeare In the affliction of these terrible Dreames,
shakespeare In the corrupted currants of this world,
shakespeare In the dead wast and middle of the night
shakespeare In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,
shakespeare In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,
shakespeare In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
shakespeare In the poysond Entrailes throw
shakespeare In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
shakespeare In the vnshrinking station where he fought,
shakespeare In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
shakespeare In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
shakespeare In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,
shakespeare In this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.
shakespeare In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
shakespeare In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
shakespeare In this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other
shakespeare In this so sudden business.
shakespeare In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
shakespeare In thy best robes, uncover'd, on the bier,
shakespeare In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
shakespeare In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,
shakespeare In what I further shall intend to do,
shakespeare In what vile part of this anatomy
shakespeare In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,
shakespeare In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
shakespeare In your Nature Hamlet,
shakespeare In your nature, that you can let this goe?
shakespeare In youth when I did loue, did loue,
shakespeare Inchanting all that you put in.
shakespeare Indeed I never shall be satisfied
shakespeare Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,
shakespeare Industrious Souldiership
shakespeare Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,
shakespeare Inform her full of my particular fear,
shakespeare Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
shakespeare Interest of territory, cares of state),
shakespeare Into her womb convey sterility;
shakespeare Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me
shakespeare Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this.
shakespeare Into the Flame
shakespeare Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,
shakespeare Is Mortals cheefest Enemie.
shakespeare Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
shakespeare Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
shakespeare Is banished; and all the world to nothing
shakespeare Is but a little way above our heads,
shakespeare Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
shakespeare Is by a forged processe of my death
shakespeare Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
shakespeare Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
shakespeare Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
shakespeare Is death to any he that utters them.
shakespeare Is empty on the back of Montague,--
shakespeare Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress' name,
shakespeare Is falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,
shakespeare Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
shakespeare Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd
shakespeare Is guilty of this lamentable chance!--The lady stirs.
shakespeare Is he dispatch'd?
shakespeare Is he gone, and hath nothing?
shakespeare Is it e'en so? why then, I thank you all;
shakespeare Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!--
shakespeare Is it good-den?
shakespeare Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
shakespeare Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,
shakespeare Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.
shakespeare Is left this Vault, to brag of.
shakespeare Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
shakespeare Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
shakespeare Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
shakespeare Is my dear son with such sour company:
shakespeare Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
shakespeare Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
shakespeare Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
shakespeare Is not this something more then Fantasie?
shakespeare Is not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,
shakespeare Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,
shakespeare Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
shakespeare Is often laudable, to do good sometime
shakespeare Is partly to behold my lady's face,
shakespeare Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.
shakespeare Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue
shakespeare Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
shakespeare Is she a Capulet?
shakespeare Is she not down so late, or up so early?
shakespeare Is she not proud? doth she not count her bles'd,
shakespeare Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,
shakespeare Is the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:
shakespeare Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
shakespeare Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
shakespeare Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
shakespeare Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues
shakespeare Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:
shakespeare Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
shakespeare Is thought-sicke at the act
shakespeare Is three long hours,--yet she is not come.
shakespeare Is thy news good or bad? answer to that;
shakespeare Is to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,
shakespeare Is too much for a score
shakespeare Is very good meat in Lent;
shakespeare Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
shakespeare Is't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,
shakespeare Is't farre you ride?
shakespeare It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
shakespeare It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
shakespeare It best agrees with night.--Come, civil night,
shakespeare It burneth in the Capels' monument.
shakespeare It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
shakespeare It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
shakespeare It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
shakespeare It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
shakespeare It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
shakespeare It had bene as a gap in our great Feast,
shakespeare It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
shakespeare It hath no end
shakespeare It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,
shakespeare It helps not, it prevails not,--talk no more.
shakespeare It is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
shakespeare It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,
shakespeare It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:
shakespeare It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:
shakespeare It is an honour that I dream not of.
shakespeare It is enough I may but call her mine.
shakespeare It is most retrograde to our desire:
shakespeare It is my lady; O, it is my love!
shakespeare It is my soul that calls upon my name:
shakespeare It is my will; the which if thou respect,
shakespeare It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,
shakespeare It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
shakespeare It is some meteor that the sun exhales
shakespeare It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!--
shakespeare It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
shakespeare It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,
shakespeare It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
shakespeare It is, it is!--hie hence, be gone, away!
shakespeare It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't
shakespeare It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
shakespeare It may be so, for it is not mine own.--
shakespeare It may be thought we held him carelessly,
shakespeare It rains downright.--
shakespeare It seemes it is as proper to our Age,
shakespeare It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
shakespeare It selfe, for being there
shakespeare It sends some precious instance of it selfe
shakespeare It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce
shakespeare It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
shakespeare It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,
shakespeare It should not stand in thy Posterity,
shakespeare It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
shakespeare It strains me past the compass of my wits:
shakespeare It wafts you to a more remoued ground:
shakespeare It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,
shakespeare It was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane
shakespeare It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
shakespeare It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
shakespeare It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it
shakespeare It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
shakespeare It were a grief so brief to part with thee:
shakespeare It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence
shakespeare It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,
shakespeare It would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.
shakespeare It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
shakespeare Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the
shakespeare Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
shakespeare Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
shakespeare Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
shakespeare Juliet, Daughter to Capulet.
shakespeare Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you:
shakespeare Juliet, the county stays.
shakespeare Juliet.
shakespeare Just in her case!
shakespeare Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
shakespeare K. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety
shakespeare Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!
shakespeare Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it

shakespeare That clogges me with this Answer
shakespeare That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
shakespeare That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
shakespeare That dotage gives it.
shakespeare That dreamers often lie.

shakespeare That euer I was borne to set it right.
shakespeare That euery minute of his being, thrusts

shakespeare That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
shakespeare That guard and most unusual vigilance
shakespeare That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none
shakespeare That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,

shakespeare That is because the traitor murderer lives.
shakespeare That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
shakespeare That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him
shakespeare That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a making:
shakespeare That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;

shakespeare That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
shakespeare That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
shakespeare That monthly changes in her circled orb,
shakespeare That most may clayme this argument for ours?
shakespeare That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
shakespeare That murder'd my love's cousin,--with which grief,
shakespeare That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits
shakespeare That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:
shakespeare That often Madnesse hits on,
shakespeare That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;
shakespeare That one short minute gives me in her sight:
shakespeare That open'd lies within our remedie
shakespeare That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,
shakespeare That palter with vs in a double sence,
shakespeare That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
shakespeare That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear;

shakespeare That same villain Romeo.
shakespeare That sees into the bottom of my grief?
shakespeare That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.
shakespeare That shake vs Nightly: Better be with the dead,
shakespeare That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
shakespeare That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
shakespeare That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,
shakespeare That she that even but now was your best object,
shakespeare That shew of such an exercise may colour
shakespeare That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,
shakespeare That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
shakespeare That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
shakespeare That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
shakespeare That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
shakespeare That speake him full of Grace.
shakespeare That speake my salutation in their minds:
shakespeare That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces
shakespeare That still would manage those authorities
shakespeare That strike beside vs
shakespeare That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,
shakespeare That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley
shakespeare That such a king should play bo-peep
shakespeare That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:
shakespeare That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
shakespeare That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through
shakespeare That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,

shakespeare That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
shakespeare That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
shakespeare That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.
shakespeare That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer
shakespeare That they haue don't?
shakespeare That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
shakespeare That this great King may kindly say,
shakespeare That this our court, infected with their manners,
shakespeare That thou consent to marry us to-day.
shakespeare That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
shakespeare That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.
shakespeare That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
shakespeare That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
shakespeare That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
shakespeare That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?
shakespeare That thus he suffers for
shakespeare That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
shakespeare That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,--
shakespeare That trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,
shakespeare That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
shakespeare That two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.
shakespeare That unsubstantial death is amorous;
shakespeare That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
shakespeare That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,
shakespeare That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
shakespeare That was not borne of Woman? Such a one
shakespeare That we finde out the cause of this effect,
shakespeare That we have had no time to move our daughter:
shakespeare That we may call it early by and by.--
shakespeare That we our largest bounty may extend
shakespeare That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
shakespeare That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,
shakespeare That were some spite: my invocation
shakespeare That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?
shakespeare That when the Braines were out, the man would dye,
shakespeare That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth
shakespeare That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;
shakespeare That while Verona by that name is known,
shakespeare That will with due decision make vs know
shakespeare That with wings as swift
shakespeare That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,
shakespeare That would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.
shakespeare That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,
shakespeare That writes them all alike: and so of men.
shakespeare That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;--
shakespeare That you are so
shakespeare That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall
shakespeare That you bend your eye on vacancie,
shakespeare That you doe lye so late?
shakespeare That you know ought of me; this not to doe:
shakespeare That you must lose a husband.
shakespeare That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any
shakespeare That you protect this course, and put it on
shakespeare That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
shakespeare That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
shakespeare That you shall rest but little.--God forgive me!
shakespeare That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court
shakespeare That your good Beauties be the happy cause
shakespeare That youth and obseruation coppied there;
shakespeare That's a certain text.
shakespeare That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde
shakespeare That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
shakespeare That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
shakespeare That's my good son: but where hast thou been then?
shakespeare That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
shakespeare That, if they come to sojourn at my house,
shakespeare That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
shakespeare Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:

shakespeare The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
shakespeare The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,

shakespeare The better to beguile. This is for all:

shakespeare The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
shakespeare The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,
shakespeare The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.--
shakespeare The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
shakespeare The close contriuer of all harmes,
shakespeare The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,
shakespeare The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
shakespeare The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:
shakespeare The country gives me proof and precedent
shakespeare The county will be here with music straight,
shakespeare The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
shakespeare The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:--
shakespeare The curiosity of nations to deprive me,

shakespeare The date is out of such prolixity:
shakespeare The day almost it selfe professes yours,
shakespeare The day is broke; be wary, look about.
shakespeare The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
shakespeare The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
shakespeare The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.

shakespeare The flighty purpose neuer is o're-tooke
shakespeare The fool no knave, perdy.
shakespeare The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
shakespeare The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,

shakespeare The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
shakespeare The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out

shakespeare The more I have, for both are infinite.
shakespeare The most you sought was her promotion;
shakespeare The multiplying Villanies of Nature
shakespeare The mysteries of Hecate and the night;

shakespeare The orchard walls are high and hard to climb;
shakespeare The other did not so.
shakespeare The other found out there.
shakespeare The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,
shakespeare The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
shakespeare The people in the street cry Romeo,
shakespeare The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
shakespeare The powre of man: For none of woman borne
shakespeare The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes; these

shakespeare The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
shakespeare The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
shakespeare The suppliance of a minute? No more
shakespeare The sweet and bitter fool
shakespeare The sweeter welcome:
shakespeare The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,
shakespeare The tears have got small victory by that;
shakespeare The tedious day with sleepe
shakespeare The termes of our estate, may not endure
shakespeare The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
shakespeare The time and my intents are savage-wild;

shakespeare The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
shakespeare The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
shakespeare The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie
shakespeare The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,
shakespeare The very firstlings of my heart shall be
shakespeare The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
shakespeare The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
shakespeare The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,

shakespeare Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.
shakespeare Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
shakespeare Their Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,

shakespeare Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love;
shakespeare Therefore let's follow.
shakespeare Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
shakespeare Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,
shakespeare Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.
shakespeare Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
shakespeare Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
shakespeare Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,

shakespeare They are but beggars that can count their worth;

shakespeare They cry choose we? Laertes shall be King,
shakespeare They foole me to the top of my bent.
shakespeare They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.
shakespeare They have made worms' meat of me:

shakespeare This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
shakespeare This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it

shakespeare Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,
shakespeare Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
shakespeare Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
shakespeare Whose nature is so far from doing harms
shakespeare Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
shakespeare Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
shakespeare Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
shakespeare Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.

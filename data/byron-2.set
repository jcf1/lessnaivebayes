byron 'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-
byron 'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,
byron 'And poor Juanna, too--the child's first night
byron 'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while
byron 'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:
byron 'De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.'
byron 'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,
byron 'If you are right, then everybody's wrong.'
byron 'If you are wrong, then everybody's right.'
byron 'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know
byron 'Life 's a poor player,'--then 'play out the play,
byron 'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,
byron 'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?
byron 'Omnia vult belle Matho dicere--dic aliquando
byron 'Quite well; yes,--no.'--These answers were mysterious,
byron 'Shadows the soul of Richard' may appal.
byron 'T is always best to take things upon trust.
byron 'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:
byron 'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell
byron 'T is said it makes reality more bearable:
byron 'T is strange,--but true; for truth is always strange;
byron 'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,
byron 'T is time that some new prophet should appear,
byron 'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as
byron 'T is true he saw Aurora look as though
byron 'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,
byron 'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.
byron 'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard
byron 'T is wonderful what fable will not do!
byron 'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old
byron 'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
byron 'T was all the same to him--'God save the king,'
byron 'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,
byron 'T were difficult to say what was the object
byron 'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling
byron 'Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,
byron 'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.
byron 'Twixt place and patriotism--albeit compell'd,
byron 'Untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'
byron 'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best
byron 'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told
byron 'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest
byron (But many a lonely tree the loftier grows
byron (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,
byron (By those who have not had such visitations),
byron (Especially as the sixth year is ending)
byron (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)
byron (For little things upon my lord's estate
byron (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
byron (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)

byron (I'll take the likeness I can first come at),
byron (In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair

byron (When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.

byron A Russ or Turk--the one 's as good as t' other.
byron A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
byron A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
byron A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late
byron A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;
byron A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward
byron A corner for herself; and therefore fiction
byron A dashing demoiselle of good estate,
byron A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'
byron A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole
byron A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.
byron A few words of condolence on his state:
byron A figure fit to walk before a king;
byron A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.
byron A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
byron A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
byron A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,
byron A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,
byron A little turn for mischief you might trace
byron A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,
byron A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;
byron A mighty mug of moral double ale.
byron A mode adopted since by modern youth.
byron A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,
byron A most important outwork of the city--
byron A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,
byron A page where Time should hesitate to print age,
byron A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,
byron A picture is the past; even ere its frame
byron A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd
byron A pretty name as one would wish to read,
byron A prologue which but slightly harmonised
byron A proud humility, if such there be,
byron A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath
byron A reel within a bottle is a mystery,
byron A remnant of our Spartan dead!
byron A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.
byron A second for her excellent connections;
byron A sincere woman's breast,--for over-warm
byron A single cry would bring them all abroad:
byron A single shade 's sufficient to entrance
byron A slight repast makes people love much more,
byron A something like it, as bear witness Luther.
byron A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.
byron A supernatural agent--or a mouse,
byron A theme for pity or some worse emotion;
byron A thing of impulse and a child of song;
byron A thing of temperament and not of art,
byron A thing which happens everywhere each day--
byron A thing, of which similitudes can show
byron A third, because there can be no objections.
byron A very handsome house from out his guilt,
byron A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.
byron A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.
byron A visitant at intervals appears;
byron A watchword till the future shall be free.
byron A wilderness of the most rare conceits,
byron A wise man more than laughter from a dunce--
byron About the day--the era 's more obscure.
byron About the present, past, or future state.
byron Above all, I beg all men to forbear
byron According to the best of dictionaries,
byron Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,
byron Adeline and Don Juan rather blended
byron Adeline, no deep judge of character,
byron Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,
byron Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,
byron Advances with exasperated rap,
byron After some fascinating hesitation,--
byron Again through shadows of the night sublime,
byron Again--what is 't? The wind? No, no--this time
byron Against her being mention'd as well fitted,
byron Ah!--What should follow slips from my reflection;
byron Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
byron Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:
byron All comedies are ended by a marriage;
byron All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,
byron All nations have believed that from the dead
byron All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,
byron All present life is but an interjection,
byron All there was as he left it: still his taper
byron All these were unobjectionable matches,
byron All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,
byron All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber
byron Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.
byron Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel
byron Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams
byron Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,
byron Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke
byron Also the conference which we have seen
byron Also the younger men too: for a springald
byron Also there bin another pious reason
byron Also thereon,--but that 's not much; we find
byron Although I wonder how it grew habitual.
byron Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue
byron Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
byron Amidst life's infinite variety:
byron Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and 'fowl,
byron Amongst the higher spirits of the day,
byron Amongst the paths of being 'taken in,'
byron Amongst you, about Leila's education.
byron Amundeville is lord by day,
byron An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,
byron An age--expectant, powerless, with his eyes
byron An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.
byron An edifice no less sublime than strong,
byron Anacreon only had the soul to tie an
byron And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,
byron And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death
byron And I know nothing which could make amends
byron And I shall take a much more serious air
byron And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,
byron And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
byron And Juan too, especially the latter.
byron And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
byron And Juan, on retiring for the night,
byron And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust
byron And Juan, too, in general behind none
byron And Socrates, that model of all duty,
byron And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.
byron And a long eulogy of 'patent blacking.'
byron And a young race-horse of old pedigree
byron And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
byron And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.
byron And always have done, somehow these good looks
byron And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,
byron And as for love--O love!--We will proceed.
byron And being present, now began to express
byron And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
byron And champion him to the utmost'--he would keep it,
byron And conscience ask a curious sort of question,
byron And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,
byron And cut through such canals of contradiction,
byron And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,
byron And deem'd that fallen worship far more dear
byron And dignity with courtesy so blending,
byron And do not think I mean to sneer at most
byron And don't regret the time you may have lost,
byron And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.
byron And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,
byron And eke the wise, as has been often shown.
byron And everybody wondering more or less,
byron And expell'd the friars, one friar still
byron And false--though true; for surely they 're sincerest
byron And families, even to the last relation;
byron And find a quincy very hard to treat;
byron And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,
byron And for which Nature might forego her debt--
byron And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,
byron And from its context thought she could divine
byron And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines
byron And gather'd as they run like growing water
byron And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,
byron And grace is said; the grace I should have sung--
byron And grieved for those who could return no more.
byron And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;
byron And hastily--as nothing can confound
byron And hate those who won't let them come to pass.
byron And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
byron And he 'll say nought to you;
byron And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,
byron And he did not seem form'd of clay,
byron And he stood gazing out on the cascade
byron And her voice was the warble of a bird,
byron And his mass of the days that are gone.
byron And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;
byron And if it is impossible, you shall:
byron And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood
byron And is not much improved by growing old.'
byron And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;
byron And kept her heart serene within its zone.
byron And knew no better in her immorality
byron And lo! upon that day it came to pass,
byron And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'
byron And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.
byron And lose their own in universal death.
byron And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.
byron And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;
byron And merely state, though not for the consistory,
byron And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.
byron And morally decided, the best state is
byron And much was talk'd on all sides on that head:
byron And naturally thought they could have plunder'd
byron And never had as yet a quiet day
byron And never straining hard to versify,
byron And no more handy substitute been near.
byron And not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,
byron And not in vain he listen'd;--Hush! what 's that?
byron And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon
byron And now I will give up all argument;
byron And now and then a nightingale) is dim,
byron And now, that we may furnish with some matter all
byron And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,
byron And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,
byron And others of themselves and latter ends.
byron And positively henceforth no temptation
byron And pride my feeble:--let us ramble on.
byron And promises to all--which last commenced
byron And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
byron And rather variably for stony death.
byron And really, if the sage sublime and Attic
byron And recollect the time when all this cant
byron And rend'ring general that which is especial.
byron And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.
byron And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
byron And sang with much simplicity,--a merit
byron And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since--
byron And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
byron And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.
byron And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,
byron And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.
byron And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:
byron And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
byron And so for one will I, as well I may.
byron And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;
byron And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.
byron And such is victory, and such is man!
byron And such was she, the lady of the cave:
byron And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:
byron And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.
byron And taught him when to be reserved or free:
byron And that in his confusion he had caught
byron And that it is so everybody knows
byron And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
byron And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl
byron And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,
byron And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)--
byron And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.
byron And theirs:--without a struggle for priority,
byron And then he had good looks;--that point was carried
byron And then her dress--what beautiful simplicity
byron And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,
byron And then of course the circle much admires,
byron And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,
byron And then there are such things as love divine,
byron And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,
byron And then there was--but why should I go on,
byron And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.
byron And then, the mid-day having worn to one,
byron And then--they calculated on his ransom.
byron And therefore I shall open with a line
byron And therefore Juan now began to rally
byron And therefore all we have related in
byron And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;
byron And therefore of Circassians had good store,
byron And therefore was she kind and gentle as
byron And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;
byron And therefore, when he ran away, he did so
byron And they must be or seem what they were: still
byron And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,
byron And they seem of a parted soul.
byron And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect
byron And this at present was her kind employment.
byron And this is stronger than the strongest grape
byron And though he certainly ran many risks,
byron And though it was no opiate, slumber crept
byron And thought. I say no more--I 've said too much;
byron And throw down old--which he call'd restoration.
byron And thus they left him to his lone repose:
byron And truculent distortion of their tresses.
byron And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.
byron And turning human nature to an art.
byron And usual--Juan, when he cast a glance
byron And vegetables, all in masquerade,
byron And very much unlike what people write.
byron And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,
byron And what is strangest upon this strange head,
byron And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.
byron And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.
byron And when he look'd upon his watch again,
byron And when he walk'd down into the saloon,
byron And when upon a silent, sullen day,
byron And when you may not be sublime, be arch,
byron And whether for good, or whether for ill,
byron And whether it ought not to be disclosed,
byron And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is--
byron And wins even by a delicate dissent.
byron And with an air, to say the least, imperious,
byron And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it
byron And womankind too, if we so may say,
byron And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,
byron And yet great heroes have been bred by both.
byron And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,
byron And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,
byron And, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'
byron And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,
byron And, as the quietest of all, she might
byron And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.
byron Anticipating aught about the matter:
byron Apart from the surrounding world, and strong
byron Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,
byron Are false, but may he render'd also true,
byron Are generally prosperous in reigning;
byron Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.
byron Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,
byron Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun--
byron Are they--now furious as the sweeping wave,
byron Are topics which I sometimes introduce,
byron Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared
byron Arranging them like books on the same shelf,
byron Arrived, retired to his; but to despond
byron As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.
byron As Eldon on a lunatic commission--
byron As Juan mused on mutability,
byron As Juan should have known, had not his senses
byron As all truths must, the more they are disputed:
byron As clear as such a climate will allow;
byron As congresses of late do) of the Lady
byron As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.
byron As doubtless should be people of high birth.
byron As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit
byron As e'er brought man and woman to the brink
byron As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.
byron As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,
byron As few would ever dream could form the link
byron As for his place, he could but say this of it,
byron As form a science and a nomenclature
byron As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,
byron As human beings, or his ways are odd.
byron As if each charming word were a decree.
byron As if he had combated with more than one,
byron As if to win a part from off the weight
byron As is the custom of those Eastern climes,
byron As much from mobs as kings--from you as me.
byron As music chimes in with a melodrame.
byron As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
byron As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.
byron As pure as sanctity itself from vice,
byron As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,
byron As some who labour more and yet may charm less.
byron As sometimes happens in a great extremity;
byron As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
byron As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'
byron As the mere pastime of an idle day,
byron As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
byron As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.
byron As touch'd, and plaintively began to play
byron As usual--the same reason which she late did.
byron As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.
byron As wide as if a long speech were to come.
byron As women hate half measures, on the whole,
byron As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.
byron Aside his very mirror soon was put;
byron Ask'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'
byron Assembled with our hostess and mine host.
byron At eighteen, though below her feet still panted
byron At first, then kindling into animation,
byron At hand, as one may like to have a fan,
byron At least 't was rather early to begin;
byron At least nine tenths of what we call so;--God
byron At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.
byron At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
byron At present I am glad of a pretence
byron At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.
byron At seventy years had phantasies like these,
byron At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
byron At the full board, and sit alike delighted
byron At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's
byron At whatsoever risk of being defeated.
byron At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;
byron Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes
byron Aurora Raby, a young star who shone
byron Aurora at the last (so history mentions,
byron Aurora sat with that indifference
byron Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.
byron Aurora, who in her indifference
byron Aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,
byron Aurora--since we are touching upon taste,
byron Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know
byron Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl
byron Backward and forward to the echoes faint
byron Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.
byron Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;
byron Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he
byron Because I 'd rather it should be forgot,
byron Because as ages upon ages push on,
byron Because he either meant to sneer at harmony
byron Because he fixed it, and to stop his talking
byron Because he had, like Alcibiades,
byron Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce;
byron Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,
byron Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,
byron Because my business is to dress society,
byron Because she did not pin her faith on feature.
byron Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit
byron Because the present tale has oft been told,
byron Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark
byron Before you learn to call this superstition.
byron Beheld between the country and the town,
byron Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
byron Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;
byron Believe:--if 't is improbable you must,
byron Below his window waved (of course) a willow;
byron Below stairs on the score of second courses;
byron Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?
byron Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,
byron Bent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.
byron Betraying only now and then her soul
byron Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,
byron Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
byron Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
byron Blood is not water; and where shall we find
byron Both busy (as a general in his tent
byron Both in the case of lover and of friend,
byron Both which are limited to no condition.
byron Bows have they, generally with two strings;
byron Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,
byron Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,
byron Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,
byron Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,
byron Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'
byron Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,
byron Bull something of the lower world's condition.
byron Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,
byron But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er
byron But 'laissez aller'--knights and dames I sing,
byron But 'why then publish?'--There are no rewards
byron But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
byron But Adeline was occupied by fame
byron But Adeline was of the purest vintage,
byron But Adeline, who probably presumed
byron But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.
byron But I digress: of all appeals,--although
byron But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!
byron But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.
byron But I must crowd all into one grand mess
byron But I suspect in fact that white is black,
byron But Juan felt, though not approaching home,
byron But Juan had a sort of winning way,
byron But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,
byron But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,
byron But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,
byron But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,
byron But after, there are sometimes certain signs
byron But all are better than the sigh supprest,
byron But all the ladies, save some twenty score,
byron But all, except their sun, is set.
byron But always choosing with deliberation,
byron But apprehensive of his spectral guest,
byron But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,--
byron But as subservient to a moral use;
byron But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
byron But both were thrown away amongst the fens;
byron But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,
byron But could he quit his king in times of strife,
byron But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,
byron But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.
byron But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
byron But draw the long bow better now than ever.
byron But for his judgment--never known to fail.
byron But for my own peculiar superstition:
byron But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,
byron But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth
byron But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.
byron But gazing on each glowing maid,
byron But here again, why will I thus entangle
byron But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,
byron But if a writer should be quite consistent,
byron But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
byron But innocently so, as Socrates;
byron But leave them to the conscience of the nations.
byron But lover, poet, or astronomer,
byron But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):
byron But modesty 's at times its own reward,
byron But nature 's nature, and has more caprices
byron But next to dressing for a rout or ball,
byron But not to go too far, I hold it law
byron But now I can't tell where it may not run.
byron But now it seems he's right, his notion just,
byron But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.
byron But of all nature's discrepancies, none
byron But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he
byron But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,
byron But once a week or fortnight, uninvited
byron But others, who were left with scarce a third,
byron But politics, and policy, and piety,
byron But seeing him all cold and silent still,
byron But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,
byron But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,
byron But so far like a lady, that 't was drest
byron But so far the immediate effect
byron But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,
byron But speculating as I cast mine eye
byron But still from that sublimer azure hue,
byron But still with the house of Amundeville
byron But such as fit an Asiatic breech;
byron But taking him into her father's house
byron But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
byron But that, at present, with immediate reference
byron But the monk is lord by night;
byron But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
byron But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:
byron But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,
byron But there 's a conversational facility,
byron But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.
byron But there were she and Juan, face to face--
byron But thinks less of good eating than the whisper
byron But this I must say in my own applause,
byron But this poor girl was left in the great hall,
byron But though I am a temperate theologian,
byron But though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess
byron But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't
byron But to return unto the stricter rule
byron But true--as, if expedient, I could prove)
byron But various as the various meats display'd:
byron But visions of an apple and a bee,
byron But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);
byron But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
byron But what 's reality? Who has its clue?
byron But what confused him more than smile or stare
byron But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
byron But what with keeping some, and breaking others,
byron But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;
byron But whether reverend Rapp learn'd this in Germany
byron But which is best, you know no more than I.
byron But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,
byron But with a heavenly rapture on his face.
byron But with the Lady Adeline the most.
byron But wonder they so few are, since my tale is
byron But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'
byron But, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,
byron But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;
byron By an impartial indemnification
byron By borrowing a new one from an ox.
byron By death, when we are left, alas! behind,
byron By deeming that my Muse's conversation
byron By his seeming independent in his lays,
byron By last night's ghost been driven from their defences.
byron By many virtues, to be worth the trouble
byron By matter, and so much materialised,
byron By nature soft, his whole address held off
byron By nature, as in higher dames less hale
byron By some odd chance too, he was placed between
byron By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd
byron By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,
byron By those who sow them in a land that 's arable.
byron By turns--with that vivacious versatility,
byron By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in
byron By which such sirens can attract our great,
byron By whose degrees all characters are class'd--
byron CANTO THE SEVENTEENTH.
byron Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.
byron Call'd brotherly affection, could not move
byron Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
byron Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!
byron Can never be described; we all have heard,
byron Can't, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,
byron Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
byron Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;
byron Chill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high
byron Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!
byron Columbus found a new world in a cutter,
byron Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)
byron Completely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;
byron Confounded him in common with the crowd
byron Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,
byron Connexions stronger then he chose to avow
byron Considerable talent in my way.
byron Convinces all men, even a politician;
byron Could hardly be united by a dunce.
byron Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
byron Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,
byron Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)
byron Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
byron Deeming the sage would be much mortified,
byron Defying augury with that fond kiss;
byron Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;
byron Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')
byron Dissimulation always sets apart
byron Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,
byron Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;
byron Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-
byron Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken
byron Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
byron Draperied her form with curious felicity!
byron Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.
byron Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,
byron Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;
byron Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,
byron Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,
byron Each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,
byron Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search
byron Early in years, and yet more infantine
byron Erneis, Radulphus--eight-and-forty manors
byron Especially upon a printed page.
byron Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;
byron Even in the country circle's narrow bound
byron Even my veracious self?--But that 's a lie:
byron Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
byron Even then their love they could not all command,
byron Even where the article at highest rate is:
byron Even ye who know what a check'd woman is
byron Except itself;--such is the human breast;
byron Except that I have found it nothing new.'
byron Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;
byron Exists--and where? That shall I not recall,
byron Expectant of the ghost's fresh operations.
byron Experience is the chief philosopher,
byron Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.
byron Fair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'
byron Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous
byron Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,
byron Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground
byron Farther--it might or might not be so.
byron Fatigued with these hereditary glories,
byron Faults which attract because they are not tame;
byron Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:
byron Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie
byron Felt on the whole an interest intense,--
byron Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:
byron Female, as where she likes may freely pass,
byron Few females without some such gentle leaven,
byron Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;
byron Find one, each day of the delightful year;
byron First out of, and then back again to chaos,
byron Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:
byron Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
byron Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:--
byron Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,
byron Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.
byron For Adeline is half a poetess,'
byron For Adeline, addressing few words to him,
byron For Gothic daring shown in English money.
byron For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.
byron For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.
byron For I was rather famous in my time,
byron For a spoil'd carpet--but the 'Attic Bee'
byron For all her past exertion and soft phrases,
byron For all men prophesy what is or was,
byron For all the answer to his proposition
byron For any deviation from the graces
byron For any sage's creed or calculation)--
byron For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.
byron For had he not been Hercules, his span
byron For having had him to her palace led,
byron For he 's seen in the porch, and he 's seen in the church,
byron For he had two, both tolerably bright,
byron For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,
byron For him the fragrant produce of each trip;
byron For how could it go on? Explain who can!
byron For immaterialism 's a serious matter;
byron For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.
byron For me appears a question far too nice,
byron For me on earth, except some years to hide
byron For morals, marriage; and this question carried,
byron For objects worthy of the sentiment.
byron For one a songstress who hath no defect,
byron For one without has two or three within.
byron For prejudice it was--against a creature
byron For she was not a sentimental mourner
byron For shore it was, and gradually grew
byron For something better, if not wholly good;
byron For such sights, though the tale is half believed,
byron For t' other one who promises much duty;

byron For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
byron For weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able
byron For when they happen at a riper age,
byron For which small thanks are still the market price,
byron For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.
byron For you have got that pleasure still to come:
byron Fowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,
byron From answering she began to question; this
byron From any thing, this epic will contain
byron From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
byron From nature for the service of the gout--
byron From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.
byron From out the commonest demands of nature?
byron From their high places by the sideboard's stand--
byron From these they will be careful to select,
byron From town, viz., architect and dealer, were
byron Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,
byron Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,
byron Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;
byron Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,
byron Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave
byron God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-
byron God help us! Since we have need on our career
byron Gone to where victories must like dinners go.
byron Good company 's a chess-board--there are kings,
byron Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
byron Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,
byron Great Galileo was debarred the sun,
byron Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,
byron Great deeds are doing--how shall I relate 'em?
byron Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,
byron Great things were now to be achieved at table,
byron Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold
byron Grow tired of scientific conversation:
byron Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
byron Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.
byron Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,
byron Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats
byron Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;
byron Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.
byron Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,
byron Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,
byron Had lovers not some reason to regret
byron Had made more progress than for the last century.
byron Had more of her existence, for in her
byron Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled--
byron Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.
byron Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
byron Half virtues and whole vices being combined;
byron Has been declared an act of inurbanity,
byron Has not the natural stays of strict old age;
byron Has shown, I know not why they should displease
byron Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
byron Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it--
byron Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,
byron Have in their several arts or parts ascendance
byron Have plainly made it out that four are three,
byron Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.
byron Have you explored the limits of the coast,

byron He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw
byron He chose from several animals he saw--
byron He comes--but not to grieve.
byron He dress'd; and like young people he was wont
byron He first inclined to think he had been mistaken,
byron He flits on the bridal eve;
byron He found, as people on most trials must,
byron He gloried in the name of Englishman.
byron He had a predilection for that tie;
byron He had been rather indisposed of late;
byron He had the art of drawing people out,
byron He look'd in almost all respects a maid,
byron He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;
byron He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
byron He probably would have philosophised:
byron He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.
byron He read an article the king attacking,
byron He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:
byron He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,
byron He sate with feelings awkward to express
byron He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers
byron He sigh'd;--the next resource is the full moon,
byron He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'
byron He started, and said, 'Yes--no--rather--yes.'
byron He started; and perceiving smiles around
byron He still retains his sway,
byron He stood--how long he knew not, but it seem'd
byron He sweeps along in his dusky pall,
byron He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,
byron He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright
byron He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?
byron He was all things to all men, and dispensed
byron He was as independent--ay, much more--
byron He who doubts all things nothing can deny:
byron He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,
byron He would find others who would fain be rid so
byron He would not join them in a single sally.
byron He would not tread a factious path to praise,
byron Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,
byron Heaven sain him, fair or foul!
byron Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life
byron Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,
byron Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.
byron Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd
byron Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,
byron Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,
byron Her aspect was as usual, still--not stern--
byron Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,
byron Her fate had been to that of all her race;
byron Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize
byron Her only son with question or surmise:
byron Her overpowering presence made you feel
byron Her own but served to set off every joke,
byron Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.
byron Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne
byron Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale
byron Hero--for what is substance to a spirit?
byron Herself extremely on the inoculation
byron Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd
byron High in high circles, gentle in her own,
byron High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;
byron Hinting that soul and body on the whole
byron Hints from the independent heart or head
byron His chamber door wide open--and went forth
byron His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,
byron His curls fell negligently o'er his front,
byron His eyes were open, and (as was before
byron His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;
byron His knights with, lotting others' properties
byron His manner was perhaps the more seductive,
byron His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,
byron His muse made increment of any thing,
byron His own internal ghost began to awaken
byron His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
byron His spirits, and without more explanation
byron His subjects by his gracious acceptation)
byron His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,
byron His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea
byron His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
byron His vessel having need of some repairs,
byron His vice--for he was of a kindling nation--
byron His word had the same value as another's.

byron How could he possibly show things existent?
byron How differently the world would men behold!
byron How less what we may be! The eternal surge
byron How little do we know that which we are!
byron How much would novels gain by the exchange!
byron How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity
byron How oft would vice and virtue places change!
byron How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill

byron I have seen such--but must not call to mind.
byron I knew him in his livelier London days,
byron I know not; but her colour ne'er was high--
byron I leave the thing a problem, like all things.
byron I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;
byron I merely mean to say what Johnson said,
byron I must not introduce even a spare rib here,
byron I never did so, never will--how should I?
byron I own no prosody can ever rate it
byron I said it was a story of a ghost--
byron I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,
byron I say I do believe a haunted spot
byron I say, in my slight way I may proceed
byron I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,

byron Imagination 's quite enough for that:
byron Imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:
byron Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,
byron Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze
byron In Babylon's bravuras--as the home
byron In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'
byron In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:
byron In a most edifying conversation,
byron In all the others all she loves is love,
byron In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all
byron In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,
byron In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--
byron In fact, his manner was his own alone;
byron In figure, she had something of sublime
byron In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,
byron In him some feelings he had lately lost,
byron In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes
byron In its behalf, let those deny who will.
byron In listening merely to his voice's tone.
byron In making him as silent as a ghost,

byron Juan knew nought of such a character--
byron Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!

byron Juan replied, with all becoming deference,

byron Judging by what they take, and what they pay.

byron Like 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few
byron Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,
byron Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'--but 't is the same);--
byron Like a good ship entangled among ice,
byron Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,
byron Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,
byron Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,
byron Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind
byron Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza

byron Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;
byron Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,

byron May sit like that of Nessus, and recall

byron Men whose historical superiority
byron Methinks these are the most tremendous words,
byron Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,
byron Might come or go; but Juan could not state
byron Might have from time acquired some slight defect;
byron Might probably attain both in the end,
byron Mild, but at times a sort of Hercules furens;
byron Mischief in families, as some know or knew,
byron More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)
byron More circumstances? vain was every care;
byron More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I
byron More joy than from all future pride or praise,
byron More virgin valour never dreamt of flying
byron More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,
byron Most people as it plays along the arras.
byron Mournful--but mournful of another's crime,
byron Must I pass over in my bill of fare?
byron Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.
byron Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.
byron My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed
byron My Muse would run much more into excess,
byron My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I

byron My smiles must be sincere or not at all.
byron Myself with metaphysics? None can hate
byron New batteries were erected, and was held
byron New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.
byron Next to the making matches for herself,
byron Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,
byron No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;
byron No doubt a consolation to his dust.
byron No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
byron No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court
byron No fashion made them apes of her distortions;
byron No less a friend to government--he held,
byron No less delighted to employ his leisure;
byron No longer ready ears and short-hand pens
byron No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.
byron No more on this--the dinner-bell hath rung,
byron No more to be beheld but in such visions--
byron No process proved connubial animosity;
byron No real likeness,--like the old Tyrian vest
byron No sound except the echo of his sigh
byron No; but you have heard--I understand--be dumb!
byron Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.
byron Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,
byron Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;
byron Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.
byron Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,
byron Nor liken it--I never saw the like:
byron Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,
byron Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal
byron Nor would be thus:--the difference in them
byron Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.
byron Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
byron Not as they ought to be: for I avow,
byron Not calculating how much they condensed;
byron Not finding that the additions much encumber.
byron Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.
byron Not only for the sake of their variety,
byron Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,
byron Not witches, only bitches, who create
byron Nothing affected, studied, or constructive
byron Nought against either, and both seem'd secure--

byron Now this (but we will whisper it aside)
byron Now this at all events must render cold
byron Now this he really rather took amiss:
byron Now though we know of old that looks deceive,
byron O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily
byron O! the long evenings of duets and trios!
byron O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,
byron O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,
byron O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;
byron O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,
byron O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show
byron O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,
byron Observant of the foibles of the crowd,

byron Of our sensations! What a curious way
byron Of physics, bodies whether short or tall
byron Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,
byron Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
byron Of single gentlemen who would be double.
byron Of such a sentimental situation?
byron Of such a spirit in these halls of old,

byron Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
byron Perhaps she merely had the simple project
byron Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,

byron Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:

byron Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.
byron Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
byron Than dying tapers--and the peeping moon.
byron Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
byron Than others crowded in the forest's maze);
byron Than those who were not paid for independence,
byron Than to wax white--for blushes are for quality.
byron Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud--
byron That 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit
byron That Juan had enough of maintenance,
byron That all their glory, as a composition,
byron That any thing he views can greatly please.
byron That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,
byron That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
byron That e'er by precious metal was held in.
byron That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,
byron That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.
byron That half its produce tends to emigration,
byron That he exactly the just medium hit
byron That he had made at first a silly blunder
byron That he the night before had seen a ghost,
byron That honey of your fashionable bees--
byron That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
byron That innovation's spirit now-a-days
byron That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.
byron That is, with men: with women he was what
byron That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,
byron That most unliquidating liquid, leaves
byron That one scarce knew at what to marvel most
byron That sad result of passions and potatoes--
byron That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,
byron That source of the sublime and the mysterious:--
byron That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,
byron That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,

byron The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!
byron The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
byron The difficultly lies in colouring
byron The diners of celebrity dined well;

byron The evaporation of a joyous day
byron The evening also waned--and coffee came.
byron The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;
byron The fair czarina's autocratic crest,
byron The family physician had great skill,
byron The first is rather more than mortal can do;
byron The first--but what she could not well divine.
byron The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;

byron The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.
byron The friar of late has not been oft perceived.
byron The friend of artists, if not arts,--the owner,

byron The ghost at least had done him this much good,
byron The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.
byron The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until

byron Was much consoled by his own repartee.
byron Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;
byron Was not such as to encourage him to shine;

byron Was there chaste dame who had not in her head

byron Were all deflower'd by different grenadiers.
byron Were angry--as they well might, to be sure.
byron Were good small talk for others still less great)--
byron Were his eyes open?--Yes! and his mouth too.
byron Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
byron Were more;--but I was born for opposition.
byron Were odds against a disembodied soul.
byron Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.
byron Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'

byron What though she now and then may slip from duty,
byron What was a paradox becomes a truth or

byron Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be
byron When Adeline replied with some disgust,
byron When Adeline, in all her growing sense
byron When Nero perish'd by the justest doom
byron When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage
byron When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,
byron When any dare a new light to present:
byron When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore
byron When once decanted;--I presume to guess so,
byron When over Catholics the ocean rolls,
byron When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,
byron When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,
byron When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
byron When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?
byron Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
byron Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those
byron Where all sighs are deposited; and now
byron Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?
byron Where she was interested (as was said),
byron Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?
byron Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.
byron Whereas insisting in or out of season
byron Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,--
byron Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline
byron Whether his virtue triumphed, or at length
byron Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'
byron Whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish
byron Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic
byron Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,
byron Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.
byron Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.
byron Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,
byron Which charm most people in their earlier day:
byron Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,
byron Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd
byron Which further to explain would be a truism.
byron Which glibly glides from every vulgar tongue
byron Which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,
byron Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,
byron Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;
byron Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance
byron Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.
byron Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
byron Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;
byron Which many people take for want of heart.
byron Which may round off an hour upon a time.
byron Which ministers unto the soul's delight,
byron Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,
byron Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?
byron Which now-a-days is the thermometer
byron Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,
byron Which piques a preux chevalier--as it ought:
byron Which rings what 's uppermost of new or hoary,
byron Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:
byron Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,
byron Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.
byron Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,
byron Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
byron Which she went through as though it were a dance,
byron Which show'd such deference to what females say,
byron Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.
byron Which some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)
byron Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,
byron Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,
byron Which turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,
byron Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.
byron Which was not very wise, and still less witty,
byron Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.
byron Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
byron While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,
byron While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,
byron While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)--
byron While gentle writers also love to lift
byron While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles
byron While others wish'd that she had been so quite.
byron While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies
byron While yet America was in her non-age.
byron White, black, or copper--the dead bones will grin.
byron Who after rummaging the Abbey through thick
byron Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase
byron Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.
byron Who bids all men believe the impossible,
byron Who did not quit me when Oppression trod
byron Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation--
byron Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,
byron Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,
byron Who grow up children only, since the old saw
byron Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,
byron Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.
byron Who look upon them as they ought to do.
byron Who now are basking in their full-blown pride
byron Who seem'd the cream of equanimity
byron Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,
byron Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
byron Who sitteth by Norman stone,
byron Who thus could form a line and fight again;
byron Who were the very paragons of wives,
byron Who wish to take the tone of their society:
byron Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:
byron Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,
byron Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
byron Who, though they prove not two and two to be
byron Whoever may be the lay.
byron Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.
byron Whose heart was fix'd upon a star or blue string;
byron Whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;
byron Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken,
byron Why call'd he 'Harmony' a state sans wedlock?
byron Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.
byron Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.
byron Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.
byron Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,
byron Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon--
byron With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,
byron With 'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;
byron With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic
byron With Nature's genial genitors, so that
byron With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,
byron With all the added charm of form and feature,
byron With all the mystery by midnight caused;
byron With any body in a ride or walk.
byron With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,
byron With buildings in the Oriental taste,
byron With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
byron With massy plate for armour, knives and forks
byron With motives the most classical and pure,
byron With nature manners which are artificial,
byron With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,
byron With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;
byron With some slight, light, hereditary twinges
byron With some, while others, who had more in dread
byron With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;
byron With sword in hand, and torch to light
byron With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,
byron With the same thought the two words have help'd out:
byron With this same legend)--'if you but design
byron With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.
byron With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.
byron With two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.
byron With various similar remarks to tally,
byron With vivifying Venus, who doth owe
byron With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;
byron With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,
byron With which men image out the unknown thing
byron Within her bosom (which was not too tough)
byron Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,
byron Within these latest thousand years or later.
byron Without a small refreshment from the spheres.
byron Without the animation of the wind;
byron Without their seeing what he was about.
byron Without which life would be extremely dull;
byron Would give up artlessly both heart and head
byron Would not be driven away.
byron Would now and then as 't were without display,
byron Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.
byron Would that I were less bilious--but oh fie on't!
byron Ye powers! it is the--the--the--Pooh! the cat!
byron Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.
byron Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!
byron Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base
byron Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:
byron Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through
byron Yet made the misery of at least two lives.
byron Yet mix'd so slightly, that you can't complain,
byron Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;
byron Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.
byron Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,
byron Yet with display in fact, at times relent
byron Yet, if examined, it might be admitted
byron Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.
byron You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your

byron You 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards--
byron You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
byron You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
byron You may be Boaz, and I--modest Ruth.

byron You should be civil in a modest way:

shakespeare Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd
shakespeare Osw. What dost thou know me for?
shakespeare Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one
shakespeare Other. But is this law?

shakespeare Part, fools! put up your swords; you know not what you do.

shakespeare Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;

shakespeare Polon. That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good
shakespeare Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there

shakespeare Reads the Letter.
shakespeare Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
shakespeare Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles
shakespeare Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
shakespeare Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,
shakespeare Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.
shakespeare Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.
shakespeare Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King
shakespeare Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.
shakespeare Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!
shakespeare Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights
shakespeare Regan, Servants.

shakespeare Shake, quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,

shakespeare Shall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more
shakespeare Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?
shakespeare She hath forsworn to love; and in that vow
shakespeare She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
shakespeare She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
shakespeare She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
shakespeare She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
shakespeare She speaks:--
shakespeare She was too good for me:--but, as I said,
shakespeare She will not stay the siege of loving terms
shakespeare She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;
shakespeare She's not fourteen.
shakespeare She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;
shakespeare Should have him thus restrain'd.
shakespeare Should in the farthest east begin to draw
shakespeare Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
shakespeare Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!--

shakespeare So early walking did I see your son:
shakespeare So far from sounding and discovery,
shakespeare So farewell to you both.
shakespeare So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes
shakespeare So humbly take my leaue
shakespeare So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,
shakespeare So much commend itself, you shall be ours.
shakespeare So poorely in your thoughts
shakespeare So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
shakespeare Soft! I will go along:
shakespeare Some comfort, nurse.
shakespeare Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
shakespeare Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
shakespeare Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there

shakespeare That no compunctious visitings of Nature
shakespeare That rude eyes may wink, and Romeo
shakespeare That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
shakespeare That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
